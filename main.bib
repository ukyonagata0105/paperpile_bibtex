               advantage, streams of innovation, and enhanced value creation. In
               terms of negative social impacts, Airbnb has been associated with
               income inequalities and social segregation resulting from higher
               property prices. These impacts have usually been attributed to
               Airbnb in a straightforward, overly simplistic manner that
               reflects the typical analytical approach used in academia and
               work life to assess the social impacts of digital platforms. In
               this chapter, it is argued that these analytical approaches cut

               influenced by interactions between public, private, and civil
               society actors and activities. Here we explore the social impacts

               companies run under two different regulatory schemes (cost-plus
               or fixed-price), using the approach proposed by Kumbhakar et al.
               (1991), Huang and Liu (1994) and Battese and Coelli (1995). The
               main evidence is that, given network characteristics, transit
               operators with high-powered incentive contracts (fixed-price
               subsidies) exhibit lower distortions from the minimum costs.
               Environmental conditions (network speed levels) also have a
               significant impact on inefficiency differentials and influence

               negotiated procedure. This paper seeks to evaluate the
               performance of urban bus operators in small- and medium-sized
               municipalities according to their prevailing contractual regimes.
               Three types of procurement procedure are analyzed: competitive
               tendering, negotiated contracts and contracts negotiated
               indirectly with the interurban bus provider. A translog
               stochastic cost frontier is conducted using a panel dataset (312
               observations) over a nine-year period from 2007 to 2015 for the
               municipalities of the Barcelona province. In line with recent
               empirical evidence, we find no cost differences between the three
               contractual procedures. However, cost inefficiencies emerge in
               relation to the size of the municipality: the smaller the
               municipality, the greater the inefficiencies. As for ownership,
               there are no performance differences between private and other
               forms of delivery. Economies of density are no longer apparent at
               annual provisions above 300,000 vehicle-kilometers or in
               municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. Therefore, the
               non-tendering option, as provided for under European Regulations
               for small concessions, gives the same results as that found for
               competitive tendering and indirectly negotiated procedures.",

               subsidies, and ridership. More specifically, we examine to what
               extent (multiple) contract renewals and introduction of
               competitive tendering for long-term public transport contracts
               affect ridership, operational costs and subsidies in concession
               areas governed by public transportation authorities from 2001
               until 2013 in the Netherlands. Our identification strategy
               improves on the literature as we are able to control for all
               time-invariant unobserved factors, such as network and area
               characteristics by using panel data. We show that when renewing
               long-term contracts, operational costs are reduced by at least
               10\%, whereas subsidies fall even stronger. For contracts that
               are renewed at least twice, the reduction in costs is even more
               substantial and in the order of 16\%. We find that the effect of
               competitive tendering is completely absent, suggesting that the
               threat of competitive tendering is sufficient in a market where
               the majority of concessions is competitive tendered. Contract
               renewal not only reduces costs and subsidies, but simultaneously
               increases public transport ridership by 7.7\%. Furthermore the
               vehicle-hours elasticity of operational costs is 0.40, pointing
               to strong economies of density. The geographical scale elasticity
               of operational costs is around one, which indicates constant
               returns to scale with respect to the geographical size of the
               concession area. This suggest that the current size of the Dutch
               concession area is optimal with respect to costs.",

                 persist and collaborations to address them at a local level are
                 yet to prove effective. One potential way of improving actions
                 to address health inequalities is to pay greater attention to
                 the way the problems and solutions are framed. Aims and
                 objectives:The aims of the study were to: 1) review existing
                 advice and guidance on how to frame the wider determinants of
                 health, health inequalities and how to address them in policy;
                 2) critically appraise this guidance with reference to a study
                 of local action to address the wider determinants of health and
                 health inequalities in England; and 3) offer insight into the
                 future of framing these issues at the local level. Methods:An
                 exploratory qualitative study of local actors’ activities and
                 experiences that relate to framing health inequalities.
                 Analysis is drawn from 14 in-depth, qualitative interviews with
                 people working in health- and other-sector partnerships.
                 Findings:Local actors engaged in systemic framing of the wider
                 determinants, health inequalities and what to do about them
                 across localities, albeit in a non-routinised or uniform way.
                 Evidence and data were a key part of telling the story. Owing
                 in part to resource constraint, local practitioners tended to
                 work with people who quickly ‘got it’ (the structural, systemic
                 nature of health inequalities) and focused their efforts on
                 working in these partnerships; this was a reflection of the
                 relational process of ‘co-framing’. Other tactics were used to
                 try and persuade unconvinced colleagues or elected members.
                 There were multiple challenges, however, to framing
                 consistency, coherency and comprehensiveness of coverage, and
                 using a systemic frame was no guarantee of cross-sectoral
                 collaborative working. Discussion and conclusion:Re-framing
                 health inequalities is challenging and relational for local
                 practitioners. Local tactics that include tailoring, co-framing
                 and building strong local examples offer promise.",

               subsidies, and ridership. More specifically, we examine to what
               extent (multiple) contract renewals and introduction of
               competitive tendering for long-term public transport contracts
               affect ridership, operational costs and subsidies in concession
               areas governed by public transportation authorities from 2001
               until 2013 in the Netherlands. Our identification strategy
               improves on the literature as we are able to control for all
               time-invariant unobserved factors, such as network and area
               characteristics by using panel data. We show that when renewing
               long-term contracts, operational costs are reduced by at least
               10\%, whereas subsidies fall even stronger. For contracts that
               are renewed at least twice, the reduction in costs is even more
               substantial and in the order of 16\%. We find that the effect of
               competitive tendering is completely absent, suggesting that the
               threat of competitive tendering is sufficient in a market where
               the majority of concessions is competitive tendered. Contract
               renewal not only reduces costs and subsidies, but simultaneously
               increases public transport ridership by 7.7\%. Furthermore the
               vehicle-hours elasticity of operational costs is 0.40, pointing
               to strong economies of density. The geographical scale elasticity
               of operational costs is around one, which indicates constant
               returns to scale with respect to the geographical size of the
               concession area. This suggest that the current size of the Dutch
               concession area is optimal with respect to costs.",

               and what characterises a ‘MaaS service’, as well as to propose a
               topology of MaaS as a tool for facilitating the discussion of
               MaaS, enabling the ‘comparison of’ different services,
               understanding MaaS' potential effects, and aiding the integration
               of societal goals into MaaS services. Based on an exploration of
               existing definitions and descriptions of MaaS, and an expert
               workshop identifying key aspects and ascertaining service
               differentiations accordingly, the resulting proposed topology
               consists of MaaS Levels 0 to 4 as characterised by different
               types of integration: 0 no integration; 1 integration of
               information; 2 integration of booking and payment; 3 integration
               of the service offer, including contracts and responsibilities; 4
               integration of societal goals. The levels are then described in
               terms of their added value and further discussed regarding
               implications for society, business, users/customers, and
               technical requirements. Then, a deeper discussion also delves
               into the potential in expanding upon Level 4 and ways by which
               services and societal goals can become more fully integrated. The
               proposed topology adds clarity to the discussion of such a
               trending topic and enables the positioning of services along the
               MaaS spectrum. It also deepens the understanding of why MaaS can
               take time to establish, and can help support the development of
               action plans in terms of what needs to be done depending on what
               type of MaaS one wants to develop. Further analysis is desirable
               regarding the possibilities and problems linked with the
               different levels of MaaS. Such an analysis is key to
               understanding which effects can be achieved via the

               e.g. social, economic and ecological sustainability, and business

               strategic voting behavior in post-2012 Japan. Since the Liberal
               Democratic Party (LDP) returned to power in 2012, it has been
               winning every national election, while the opposition camp has
               been fragmented into many parties, none of which has been seen as
               a viable contender to the LDP. In this situation in which the LDP
               will certainly win, there are citizens who vote for an opposition
               party, especially the largest one, though they do not believe it
               is capable of governing the country. Their concern is the balance
               of seats among the parties. These strategic voters tend to be
               older, more educated, richer, and more attentive to political
               news than those who genuinely support the opposition.",

  abstract  = "Mobility as a Service (MaaS) developments have thus far
               progressed along different trajectories in Sweden and Finland,
               two pioneering countries in MaaS. Still, little is known about
               why this is. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the
               role of institutions as key structures given their capacity to
               bring about differentiated outcomes. Based on 31 interviews with
               key stakeholders, we first describe drivers and barriers of MaaS
               developments in the two countries. Thereafter, through an
               analysis of similarities and differences across the cases, we
               identify a set of general implications for MaaS policymakers and
               practitioners. Developments in Finland demonstrate the importance
               of top-level support, of inter-organizational collaboration and
               of trust among key stakeholders. The Swedish case reiterates the
               need for inter-sectorial collaboration, particularly with regard
               to creating the right conditions for commercialization, and to
               involving stakeholders on both strategic and operational levels
               of the transport sector in developing the vision for MaaS.
               Lastly, we assess the utility of the applied theoretical
               framework, and comment on the necessity of recognizing that both
               practice-based and structural changes are needed in order to
               facilitate institutional change.",

               broad statistics from a display, whereas poorly designed displays
               can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting global
               statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is
               slow. Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide
               attention, and respect familiar conventions. Data visualizations

  abstract    = "Abstract Policies aimed at upskilling, motivating and/or
                 disciplining the unemployed have remained a cornerstone of most
                 OECD countries’ employment policies since the 1990s. Central to
                 these policies is the idea of activation – i.e. the premise
                 that benefit entitlement is conditional on one’s participation
                 in some kind of activity. This article seek to understand how
                 this idea of activation has proven so enduring by analyzing the
                 international development of Activation Policies since 1990
                 through the lens offered by the concept of ideational
                 robustness. It is analyzed how the robustness of the idea of
                 activation has been continuously challenged through critiques
                 raised against the effects, the legitimacy and the relevance of
                 activation policies. Yet, in each of these moments of contest,
                 proponents of the idea of activation succeeded in keeping the
                 idea relevant as a point of reference for policymaking. They
                 did so by rebalancing disciplinary and enabling approaches to
                 activation, adding a new scope of application for activation
                 policies, and rearticulating the underlying assumption about
                 client agency. The analysis further reveals how these
                 robustness mechanisms succeeded in appropriating the critiques
                 due to their inscription within the technical and seemingly
                 de-political language concerning effect evaluations,
                 implementation deficits, and new forms of governance.
                 Policymakers were thereby able to downplay normative questions
                 of the legitimacy, fairness, and justice of activation
                 policies. The idea of activation has thus taken on a status as
                 an objective to be implemented as effective and efficiently as
                 possible rather than as an idea to be discussed or challenged.
                 However, while the idea of activation remains robust, the same
                 cannot be said of the governance and implementation structures
                 of activation policies. Our study suggest that the
                 near-constant reforms of these governance arrangements and
                 implementation structures during the last 30 years are partly a
                 consequence of critique being skewed from the idea of
                 activation to these structures and arrangements. The robustness
                 of the idea of activation has thus, rather paradoxically, come
                 about by reducing the robustness of specific activation
                 policies and governance arrangements.",

               subject of debate in the environmental sector. An essential task
               for the effective use of evidence in policymaking is for
               scientists and policymakers to share a common understanding of
               how evidence should be produced and used. The purpose of this
               study is to establish a reference framework that enables
               scientists and policymakers to align their sights to deal with
               evidence in policymaking. To develop the framework, we introduced
               five perspectives that cover the domains of science, policy, and
               the science-policy interface as: (1) methodological rigorousness;
               (2) consistency; (3) proximity; (4) social appropriateness; and
               (5) legitimacy. We then examined how the issues from these
               perspectives will transit through three phases of interaction
               between scientific investigation and political
               institutionalization via: (1) a pre-institutionalization phase,
               in which the academic and social framing of an issue was unclear;
               (2) a mid-institutionalization phase, in which the academic and
               social framing of an issue was established and
               institutionalization was advanced; and (3) a
               post-institutionalization phase, in which issues were recursively
               defined within the evidence evaluation system itself. The
               framework encourages scientists and policymakers to shift their
               perspectives to each phase of institutionalization. A case study
               on mercury pollution shows how the framework serves as a
               checklist for the comprehensive evaluation of evidence, which
               provides specific guidance that appropriately promotes
               evidence-based policymaking and its implementation.",

               integration policy and the impact of EU membership on domestic
               balance of power. Commitment to European integration is primarily
               explained by the need to secure a place among the West European
               countries in order to protect national economic and political
               interests. We examine governmental behaviour in the membership
               negotiations and the main cleavages of the 1994 membership

               significant transformation, with the government and the

               three-dimensional (3D) seismic velocity structures in the Noto
               peninsula, Japan, where swarm-like seismic activity started in
               December 2020. The obtained results reveal a highly heterogeneous
               structure in the crust. The most striking feature is the
               existence of a low-velocity anomaly in the lower crust beneath
               the Noto earthquake swarm. Although the data set used in this
               study cannot resolve the upper mantle structure, previous
               regional tomographic studies suggest that a low-velocity anomaly
               exists at depths of 50–150 km around the Noto peninsula that is
               probably interpreted as a fluid-rich region. We infer that fluids
               have been supplied from the uppermost mantle to the lower crust
               over a geological time scale and a large volume of fluids have
               accumulated below the seismogenic zone beneath the Noto
               peninsula. A further upward migration of fluids to the upper
               crust, which may have suddenly started in December 2020, probably
               triggers numerous earthquakes at depths of 10–15 km. Since major
               active faults exist at shallower extensions of the hypocenters of
               the Noto earthquake swarm, we consider that the earthquake swarm
               occurs along pre-existing and weak fault planes. Dense temporary
               seismic observations will highlight a smaller-scale (5–10 km) 3D
               seismic velocity model and finer hypocenter distribution, which
               provide additional information for better understanding of the
               generation mechanisms of the Noto earthquake swarm. Graphical

               works on EBPM, but it includes some problems. The most important

               As is well known, EBPM focuses on effectiveness and the key-term
               of it is “What Works.” However, EBPM in Japan doesn’t focus on

               the game situation changes continuously in time and space, and
               multiple agents individually recognize the game situation and
               make decisions. Previous studies using deep reinforcement
               learning have often considered teams as a single agent and valued
               the teams and players who hold the ball in each discrete event.
               Then it was challenging to value the actions of multiple players,
               including players far from the ball, in a spatiotemporally
               continuous state space. In this paper, we propose a method of
               valuing possible actions for on- and off-ball soccer players in a
               single holistic framework based on multi-agent deep reinforcement
               learning. We consider a discrete action space in each data frame
               that mimics that of Google research football and leverages
               supervised learning for actions in reinforcement learning. In the
               experiment, we analyzed the relationships with conventional
               indicators, season goals, and game ratings by experts, and showed
               the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach can assess
               how multiple players move continuously throughout the game, which
               is difficult to be discretized or labeled but vital for teamwork,
               scouting, and fan engagement.",

               narrative content. We then discuss narrative at the micro level
               of analysis and examine how narratives impact individual
               attitudes and hence aggregate public opinion. Similarly, we
               examine strategies for the studying of group and elite behavior

               feature, to the extent that we can form in terms of that feature
               some organized system of statements which describes the members
               of the set and their interrelations (at least up to some limit of
               complexity). In this sense, language can be structured in respect
               to various independent features. And whether it is structured (to
               more than a trivial extent) in respect to, say, regular
               historical change, social intercourse, meaning, or distribution -
               or to what extent it is structured in any of these respects - is
               a matter decidable by investigation. Here we will discuss how
               each language can be described in terms of a distributional
               structure, i.e. in terms of the occurrence of parts (ultimately
               sounds) relative to other parts, and how this description is
               complete without intrusion of other features such as history or
               meaning. It goes without saying that other studies of language -

                 We argue that for moving beyond neoliberalism it is not
                 sufficient to just increase the generosity of social policies:
                 what is also needed is ?social empowerment?, i.e. processes of
                 democratization of social policymaking that effectively
                 redistribute power in society, making welfare institutions
                 increasingly accountable and responsive to citizens, including
                 marginalized ones. Building on reflections and learnings

                 the underestimation, influence budget officers' assessments. We
                 conducted a survey experiment with responses from 484 budget
                 officers in local governments throughout Japan. Respondents
                 assessed a hypothetical environmental policy program budget,
                 after having been randomly assigned to one of four groups, each
                 given a different set of information and messaging: (A)
                 baseline information (including future outcome information),

                 in the two randomly assigned nudge‐based intervention groups
                 gave higher evaluations of future outcomes than those in the
                 baseline group with no nudges, whereas the assessment of the

                 of instrumentality, authority, and adaptability. In the wake of
                 renewed questions about the continued viability of longstanding
                 public administration advisory arrangements, these themes help
                 locate new pressures on those arrangement such as those linked
                 to technological developments, shifting conceptions of
                 expertise, and growing recognition of the challenges of
                 managing systems of advice. These themes help facilitate
                 continued engagement with persistent challenges linked to
                 adequate policy capacity, the role of the public service
                 advice, and question of rigour, legitimacy, and the democratic
                 contexts of policy advising.Points for practitioners
                 Technological innovations and turbulent governance arrangements
                 have renewed debates around technocracy, democratic control and
                 participation, the role of evidence, and normative and ethical
                 considerations inherent in the generation and use of policy
                 advice. Policy capacity remains important for well‐functioning
                 policy advisory systems. It has itself become multifaceted
                 reflecting not only important differences in types of expertise
                 and policy advice, but also concerns around its management and
                 deployment in varying governance contexts. The competencies
                 required for policy workers inside and outside of government
                 should reflect changes in the role of expertise and evolving
                 systems of policy advice.",

                   Othello has roughly ten octodecillion (10 to the 58th power)
                   possible game records and ten octillion (10 to the 28th

  abstract  = "AbstractThe goal of this paper is to contribute toward bridging
               the gap between policy design and implementation by focusing on
               domains, such as education, healthcare and community services,
               where policy implementation is largely left to the autonomous
               decision of public service providers, which are strategic actors
               themselves. More specifically, we suggest that two
               characteristics of policy design spaces in which policies are
               designed, i.e., the level of ideational coherence and the
               prevailing function of the adopted policy instruments, generate
               systematic patterns of responses in terms of the extent of
               compliance with policy goals, the presence of strategic gaming
               and possible defiance. We illustrate our model through a
               contrastive case study of the introduction of performance-based
               funding in the higher education sector in four European countries
               (France, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom). Our analysis
               displays that policy designs chosen by governments to steer
               public systems have different trade-offs in terms of responses of
               the public organizations involved that are essential to
               effectively implement governmental policies. The model we are
               proposing provides therefore a framework to understand how these
               interactions unfold in specific contexts, what are their effects
               on the achievement of policy goals and how policymakers could
               exploit their degrees of freedom in policy design to reduce
               unwanted effects.",

  abstract    = "Scientific evidence regularly guides policy decisions1, with
                 behavioural science increasingly part of this process2. In
                 April 2020, an influential paper3 proposed 19 policy
                 recommendations ('claims') detailing how evidence from
                 behavioural science could contribute to efforts to reduce
                 impacts and end the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we assess 747
                 pandemic-related research articles that empirically
                 investigated those claims. We report the scale of evidence and
                 whether evidence supports them to indicate applicability for
                 policymaking. Two independent teams, involving 72 reviewers,
                 found evidence for 18 of 19 claims, with both teams finding
                 evidence supporting 16 (89\%) of those 18 claims. The strongest
                 evidence supported claims that anticipated culture,
                 polarization and misinformation would be associated with policy
                 effectiveness. Claims suggesting trusted leaders and positive
                 social norms increased adherence to behavioural interventions
                 also had strong empirical support, as did appealing to social
                 consensus or bipartisan agreement. Targeted language in
                 messaging yielded mixed effects and there were no effects for
                 highlighting individual benefits or protecting others. No
                 available evidence existed to assess any distinct differences
                 in effects between using the terms 'physical distancing' and
                 'social distancing'. Analysis of 463 papers containing data
                 showed generally large samples; 418 involved human participants
                 with a mean of 16,848 (median of 1,699). That statistical power
                 underscored improved suitability of behavioural science
                 research for informing policy decisions. Furthermore, by
                 implementing a standardized approach to evidence selection and
                 synthesis, we amplify broader implications for advancing
                 scientific evidence in policy formulation and prioritization.",

               advisors. We argue that adaptive governance provides an
               interesting lens for examining the political economy of policy
               responses akin to the concept of market failure within economics,

               transactions almost by the same amount, which implies that the
               retrogression in convenience possibly caused users to shift to
               other banks for their daily payments. We also document facts

               user-generated content (e.g., YouTube) and live streaming sites
               (e.g., GeoCam), access to such videos virtually is at the
               fingertips of social science researchers. Online video data offer
               great potential for social science research to study an array of
               human interaction and behavior, but they also raise ethical
               questions to which existing guidelines and publications only
               provide partial answers. In our article we address this gap,
               drawing on existing ethical discussions and applying them to the
               use of online video data. We examine five areas in which online
               video research raises specific questions or promises unique
               potentials: informed consent, analytic opportunities, privacy,
               transparency, and minimizing harm to participants. We discuss
               their interplay and how these areas can inform practitioners,
               reviewers, and interested readers of online video studies when
               evaluating the ethical standing of a study. With this study, we
               contribute to an informed and transparent discussion about ethics
               in online video research.",

                 health policy research is limited and lacks theoretical
                 underpinnings. This article aims to describe and critique
                 different approaches to policy analysis thus providing
                 direction for undertaking policy analysis in the field of
                 health promotion. Through the use of an illustrative example in
                 nutrition it aims to illustrate the different approaches. Three
                 broad orientations to policy analysis are outlined: (i)
                 Traditional approaches aim to identify the 'best' solution,
                 through undertaking objective analyses of possible solutions.
                 (ii) Mainstream approaches focus on the interaction of policy
                 actors in policymaking. (iii) Interpretive approaches examine
                 the framing and representation of problems and how policies
                 reflect the social construction of 'problems'. Policy analysis
                 may assist understanding of how and why policies to improve
                 nutrition are enacted (or rejected) and may inform
                 practitioners in their advocacy. As such, policy analysis
                 provides researchers with a powerful tool to understand the use
                 of research evidence in policymaking and generate a heightened
                 understanding of the values, interests and political contexts
                 underpinning policy decisions. Such methods may enable more

               of local allocation tax in postwar Japan and tries to interpret
               the results in three aspects such as the introductory process of
               the welfare state, changes in regional structure during the
               economic development and horizontal political competition. The
               distribution is analyzed in the following three steps: 1) share
               of local allocation tax in total local governmental revenue; 2)
               share of municipalities and prefectures; and 3) degree of
               inclined distribution for local governments with small
               population. These analytical procedures serve to clarify changing
               intergovernmental relations. In the early stage of the high
               economic growth era, the central government gave priority to
               further economic development and left the fair distribution
               problem largely untouched. But, as the Japanese economy reached a
               certain stage of development, the public come to seek an improved
               quality of life. Following this public opinion, the central
               government changed its prior policy to provide better welfare
               services and to reduce various disparities widened in the
               economic development This change occurred in the mid-1960s. In
               public welfare provision, municipalities serve as the most
               important agents because municipalities directly relate to the
               daily lives of inhabitants. Therefore rapid progress in welfare
               provision occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s, induced an
               increase in the municipal share in the distribution of local
               allocation tax. At the same time, the degree of inclined
               distribution for municipalities with small population was raised
               sharply to secure sufficient financial revenue for increasing of
               services. With changes in the view of the welfare state after the
               Oil Shock and the following fiscal crisis, most developed
               countries began to seek “smaller” and “efficient” governments.
               This movement is well known as the New Right. Japan's national
               government also followed various policies for reducing public
               expenditure in the early 1980 s, but it made little reforms in
               local allocation tax because the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
               was politically supported by peripheral regions. With the aging
               of Japanese society, new needs of welfare provision emerged after
               the late 1980s. As the result of continuous selective
               outmigration, the percentage of elderly inhabitants in the
               peripheral regions became much higher than those in other
               regions. This led to an increase in the municipal share and more
               inclined distribution for local governments with small population
               in local allocation tax, again. Nevertheless, with the severe
               fiscal crisis by the long-term depression in the 1990s, it became
               more difficult for the national government to guarantee each
               municipality sufficient local allocation tax to meet its
               increasing fiscal needs. Additionally, urbanites began to
               criticize the extremely inclined distribution for municipalities
               with small population. Finally, the national government changed
               its stance on local allocation tax and began to drop the degree
               of inclined distribution for municipalities with small population
               after 1992. On the other hand, the national government
               established the Special Municipal Merger Support Law (Shichouson
               Gappei Tokurei Hou) and gave strong fiscal support to newly
               merged municipalities. The national government put strong
               pressure on municipalities with small population through this
               fiscal squeeze and guiding policy for merger and various merger
               plans were proposed nationwide. These contrasts between local
               allocation tax policies in the early 1980s and after the collapse
               of the Bubble economy strongly reflect the results of horizontal
               political competition between urban and rural areas. In
               particular, the Liberal Democratic Party‚s record defeat of the
               1998 House of Councilors election in metropolitan areas
               accelerated the conversion of the national government‚s local
               allocation tax policy.",

                 research,'' may seem ludicrous to scientists. Indeed, it is
                 often dismissed as a mere rhetorical device that conspiracists
                 use to give themselves the semblance of science. In this
                 perspective paper, we explore the information-seeking
                 activities (``research'') that conspiracists do engage in.
                 Drawing on the experimental psychology of aha experiences, we
                 explain how these activities, as well as the epistemic
                 experiences that precede (curiosity) or follow (insight or
                 ``aha'' experiences) them, may play a crucial role in the
                 appeal and development of conspiracy beliefs. Aha moments have
                 properties that can be exploited by conspiracy theories, such
                 as the potential for false but seemingly grounded conclusions.
                 Finally, we hypothesize that the need for autonomous epistemic
                 agency and discovery is universal but increases as people
                 experience more uncertainty and/or feel epistemically excluded

               platform. The research on MaaS is rapidly evolving, but so far
               limited attention has been paid to some of its features. In this
               study, the aspects related to MaaS are collected, and latent
               variables are analyzed based on a survey conducted among college
               students. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to
               identify the relation between the aspects of MaaS packages, the
               intention to adopt MaaS, and the attitudinal variables. It turns
               out that young users prefer to receive a wide range of
               routing-related information, but environmental and health effects
               are not among the most wanted factors. The participants are
               mostly interested in using application platforms for booking,
               paying by bank card online, and using QR codes for ticketing. The
               results show that technology readiness is closely linked with

               respondents who choose advanced aspects are more inclined to
               adopt MaaS. However, it seems that users are not willing to
               reduce car usage because of using MaaS. The findings are useful

               attention. Uncertainties therefore remain in terms of how
               public-private MaaS can be realized and governed. This paper
               addresses this problem through an exploratory case study of an
               attempt to reform the business ecosystem for mobility services in
               Sweden, which is conceptualized as a move towards public-private
               MaaS. Inspired by the What-is-the-Problem-Represented-to-Be
               approach, the paper analyzes what problem representations and
               assumptions underpin the proposed reform and outlines issues of

  abstract  = "Economic indicators are essential for policymaking and strategic
               decisions in both the public and private sectors. However, due to
               delays in the release of government indicators based on
               macroeconomic factors, there is a high demand for timely
               estimates or “nowcasting”. Many attempts have been made to
               overcome this challenge using macro indicators and key variables
               such as keywords from social networks and search queries, but
               with a reliance on human selection. We present a fully
               data-driven methodology using non-prescribed search engine query
               data (Search Big Data) to approximate economic variables in real
               time. We evaluate this model by estimating representative
               Japanese economic indicators and confirm its success in
               nowcasting prior to official announcements, even during the
               COVID-19 pandemic, unlike human-selected variable models that
               struggled. Our model shows consistent performance in nowcasting
               indices both before and under the pandemic before government
               announcements, adapting to unexpected circumstances and rapid
               economic fluctuations. An exhaustive analysis of key queries
               reveals the pivotal role of libidinal drives and the pursuit of
               entertainment in influencing economic indicators within the
               temporal and geographic context examined. This research
               exemplifies a novel approach to economic forecasting that
               utilizes contemporary data sources and transcends the limitations
               of existing methodologies.",

                 climate change and environmental degradation requires policy
                 intervention that is not only continuous but also increasing in
                 ambition over time. However, negative feedback could lead to
                 policies being weakened or even discontinued after a while. An
                 important but unresolved policy question, therefore, is whether
                 policies can be deliberately designed to survive (i.e., to
                 “stick”) and, ideally, be replaced with more ambitious ones
                 over time (i.e., to “ratchet up”). We bridge policy feedback
                 and policy design scholarship to derive hypotheses on the
                 effects of two policy design features—“intensity” (i.e., a
                 measure of policies’ overall design) and “specificity” (i.e., a
                 measure of policies’ targeted focus)—on policy
                 (dis-)continuation and ratcheting-up (-down) of ambition.
                 Focusing on policy design, we contribute to the theorization
                 and empirical understanding of endogenous factors behind policy
                 change. We test our hypotheses with an event history dataset of
                 627 low-carbon energy policies in eight developed countries.
                 Conducting a multilevel survival analysis, we find
                 statistically significant evidence of more intense policies
                 being replaced with less intense ones, i.e., more intense
                 policies lead to ratcheting-down of ambition. We also find that
                 more specific policies are more likely to be replaced with more
                 intense policies, i.e., more specific policies lead to
                 ratcheting-up of ambition. Based on these novel insights, we
                 discuss how policy design can navigate these complex dynamics.
                 In this sense, our approach also contributes to the discussion
                 about the “forward-looking” potential of the policy sciences.",

               to rethink and redefine their role in land passenger transport.
               New transportation service offerings are emerging from the
               private sector - such as ride-sharing, car-sharing and
               Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). These services, and the
               technological platforms underpinning them, have the potential to
               transform public transportation. The prospect of competition
               arising in segments of the land passenger transport market and
               supply chain is becoming reality. Some ride-sharing providers'
               business models are evolving to include small on-demand buses
               that could, and in some cases do, compete against timetabled,
               fixed route bus services. In addition, MaaS providers could be
               considered ‘retailers’ who complement and compete with public
               transport authorities in offering pricing and service bundles to
               customers. Competition drives efficiency and innovation; however,
               history shows that government decisions can easily hinder
               competition in markets where they have a significant role in
               planning, delivery and regulation. This paper explores the policy
               challenges governments will need to address to enable new
               transport services and service providers to flourish. The paper
               draws from the author's experiences in other liberalised network
               industries to explore how government public transport policies
               and governance will need to evolve to ensure competition
               flourishes where efficient.",

               households have access to some service. Subsidy policies to
               accomplish universal service may arise when private provision is
               non-universal. In the context of rural high speed wired broadband
               subsidies, this paper examines novel household-level cable and
               satellite broadband subscription data from North Carolina to
               examine household adoption and substitution patterns across
               broadband types to evaluate how many currently unserved regions
               warrant an entry subsidy. This paper has three main findings: (i)
               fewer than 43\% of households adopt high speed broadband in areas
               currently served by a single broadband provider, (ii) there
               exists evidence of a significant elasticity of substitution
               between high speed wired broadband and the lower speed options of
               satellite broadband and DSL, and (iii) a generous upper bound on
               the number of regions that warrant an entry subsidy is 64\%.
               These results suggest a policy of universal high speed wired
               broadband service in North Carolina would be unlikely to achieve
               universal adoption, would connect many households already with
               internet access and who would not substitute, and in many regions
               would be prohibitively costly even assuming very generous
               estimates of the consumer surplus generated. From the perspective
               of social welfare, to justify connecting the 5\% least dense
               areas of North Carolina would require each adopting household
               value high speed wired broadband access at more than \$1519 per

  abstract = "Recognition of the growing importance of broadband to the public
              presents challenges for policy-makers in introducing efficient
              strategies, not only to serve the increasing demand for broadband
              among people in society but also to increase their economic
              contribution both in the short run and in the long run. Different
              measures and strategies have been implemented in many countries
              and regions in order to encourage broadband deployment. Among
              them, the inclusion of broadband in the scope of universal service
              has been discussed. In the European Union, the discussion on
              broadening the scope of the Universal Service Directive (USD) to
              include broadband has been raised since the first periodical
              review in 2005. At that time, the European Commission concluded
              that only a small, although rapidly growing, minority of European
              consumers currently make use of broadband services. Therefore, the
              conditions for including broadband services within the scope of
              universal service as set out in the USD were not fulfilled. Later,
              the European Commission launched the second periodical review of
              universal service in 2008 with the preliminary conclusion that
              broadband has not yet reached the majority of people, implying
              that the conditions of the USD for expanding the scope of
              universal service were not yet fulfilled. However, the public
              consultation on broadening the scope of the USD to include
              broadband has been opened since March 2010 and was last on May 7,
              2010. In the meantime, the public workshop organized in the
              context of the public consultation on universal service principles
              in e-communications was held on March 30, 2010. The workshop
              provided wide-ranging views on the topic, including an assessment
              of the cost of broadband availability and also the rapid change of
              broadband penetration rate throughout Europe. Against this
              background, this paper provides an analytical survey of the
              current state and trends of universal service with focus on
              broadband access in the European Union. First it presents an
              overview of broadband deployment and regulation in Europe. Then,
              it analyzes the USD reviews by taking into account the previous
              and the recent review, in particular by comparing the discourse
              evolution of the public submissions from stakeholders in the two
              consultations. A framework to evaluate broadband universal service
              will be provided. In conclusion, the paper will identify selected
              issues regarding broadband universal service in Europe, especially
              the pros and cons of broadband universal service.",

  abstract  = "While both broadband itself and its speed are becoming
               increasingly important in all spheres of society, the high cost
               of providing broadband as a universal service at high speed still
               raises a fundamental question: Is the introduction of the
               universal service obligation (USO) necessary? Therefore, the
               introduction of universal broadband service at 100 Mbps in Korea
               in 2020 could be a meaningful case study to evaluate the
               necessity of broadband USO. This study proposes an estimation
               model of the costs of providing universal broadband service in
               Korea and assesses whether the introduction of the broadband USO
               was appropriate in Korea. Since the proposed model was based on
               the bottom-up (BU) approach, which establishes an efficient
               network using the latest technologies, the estimated cost of
               providing universal broadband service nationwide in Korea is
               accurate and reliable. The main findings are threefold. First,
               the total cost of providing broadband USO at 100 Mbps through the
               fiber-to-the-home technology was about 1.1 trillion Korean Won.
               Since this is a relatively small amount compared with previous
               evaluations, it could be recovered within a reasonable period
               from the monthly broadband fee that subscribers pay. Therefore,
               the result supports the introduction of universal broadband
               service in Korea. Second, there was no significant difference in
               the average cost per building for broadband USO between 50 Mbps
               and 100 Mbps; thus, the Korean government's decision to set the
               broadband speed for broadband USO at 100 Mbps was reasonable, at
               least from a cost perspective. These results imply that developed
               countries with relatively high broadband penetration, in
               particular, could consider providing universal broadband services
               of at least 50 Mbps by fiber-based technologies. Lastly, although
               the total cost of offering fiber-based universal broadband
               services in Korea was acceptable, the government could also
               consider including wireless access technology as a technological
               alternative to reduce the costs of the USO policy.",

               universal affordable broadband globally. However, a lack of data,
               combined with few independent and scientifically reproducible
               assessments, makes it challenging for governments to make
               strategic choices to achieve this goal. Therefore, new research
               approaches are required to support decision evaluation. This
               paper demonstrates an innovative method that addresses data and
               model uncertainty by developing open-source software to explore
               affordable universal broadband strategies, using a scenario-based
               hypothetical mobile operator. Targets being considered by the
               United Nations’ Broadband Commission are evaluated, with the
               financial costs of different infrastructure decisions quantified
               for the whole of the African continent. The results suggest that
               ‘leapfrogging’ to 4G is more cost efficient than 3G for providing
               universal broadband, with savings between 7 and 57 \% for 10
               GB/Month and 20–47 \% for 30 GB/Month. The baseline 4G cost for

              contractual practices are key determinants of performances. To
              test this proposition, we use an original panel data set covering
              135 different French urban transport networks over the period
              1995-2002 and we apply a stochastic frontier methodology. The
              econometric results corroborate our proposition: the technical
              efficiency of urban public transport operators depends on the
              ownership regime and on the type of contract governing their

               assessment results of Mobility as a Service pilots based on
               public-private collaboration. In the pilots, companies and local
               and regional stakeholders joined their expertise to experiment
               with different ways of organizing mobility services in rural
               areas. The pilots included demand-responsive transport and
               integrated transport of different user groups and combining trips
               that include customers paying themselves and those being publicly
               subsidized. In addition to the call centre service, a smartphone
               application was introduced. The impact assessment of these pilots
               spans individual/user, business/organizational and societal
               levels. The main findings include improved accessibility of
               transport services in rural areas and resource efficiency in
               terms of improved occupancy rates of vehicles, reduced driven
               kilometres and emissions, and cost savings for the public sector.",

               wave’, where cities attempt to harness the market; and ‘push
               backs’, where cities and citizen movements oppose marketisation.
               Although the city is constrained by marketisation at national and
               international levels, we find evidence of push back and, in it,

  abstract    = "Background: Sending a patient to the operating room is the
                 first step in surgery. Delayed patient transport causes the
                 patient to go hungry for a longer time, aggravating the
                 patient's physical discomfort and psychological stress. The
                 issue of delays in transporting inpatients to the operating
                 room has rarely been discussed in the literature. The Toyota
                 production system is a famous and excellent scientific method
                 of reducing waste and increasing efficiency. Our goal is to use
                 the Toyota method to decrease the time required to transport
                 the inpatient to the operating room and to review the concepts
                 underlying lean thinking. Methods: We employed an A3 8-step
                 problem-solving process. A current value stream map featuring
                 numerical data (concerning 46 patients) measured in the
                 workplace was developed. The total time spent on transport was
                 53 min, but we expected patients to be transported within 30
                 min. We hoped to reduce the time wasted by half, i.e., by
                 23*50\% = 12 min. These 12 min were saved by reducing the time
                 spent on ``waiting for an attendant at the ward'' by 9 min and
                 the time spent on ``elevator transport'' by 3 min. According to
                 the value stream map featuring the time measurements, the root
                 causes of delayed transportation can be divided into
                 process-related, attendant-related, and elevator-related
                 factors. We formulated 5 countermeasures. The ECRS (Eliminate,
                 Combine, Rearrange, Simplify) technique was used to rearrange,
                 combine, and simplify the existing process. Hospital executives
                 established norms for attendant prioritization of work and
                 rules for elevator use. Results: According to the original
                 indicators, all goals were attained. ``Total time spent''
                 decreased by 62.3\%. The time required for attendants to report
                 to the nursing station decreased by 56.5\%. The time spent on
                 elevator transport decreased by 44.4\%. We developed a process
                 for future use based on information-assisted patient and staff
                 identification. Finally, we standardized successful processes.
                 Conclusion: The seemingly trivial factors that delay patient
                 transport are associated with seven types of waste. The A3
                 8-step problem-solving process is useful in this context. In
                 proposing this improvement process, we believe that we are
                 following the spirit of the Toyota production system.",

               locations providing welfare-paid transport, and 194 users in
               Gunma Prefecture. [Methods] A questionnaire survey was
               distributed to the providers and users. [Results] The results of
               the questionnaire show that for continuation of service, “cost
               burden” influences welfare-paid transport providers, and that
               “reliability” influences the evaluation of the users.
               [Conclusion] Users highly evaluated welfare-paid transport, and
               for those with limited means of travel, it could become an
               important means of transport. However, while the providers

               emerged recently, and represent institutional adaptations to
               specific political and logistical circumstances. We need to
               expand the range of organisational categories that are considered
               worthy of study and develop a better understanding of the
               strengths and weaknesses of unorthodox arrangements. The concept
               of institutionalised co-production provides a useful point of
               entry. Institutionalised co-production is defined as: the
               provision of public services (broadly defined, to include
               regulation) through a regular long-term relationship between
               state agencies and organised groups of citizens, where both make
               substantial resource contributions. We explain some varieties of
               institutionalised co-production arrangements; explore why they
               appear to be relatively so widespread in poor countries; and
               relate the concept to broader ideas about public organisation.",

               evaluation system for non-monetary indices (i. e., Quality of

               generated by air transport itself, in terms of economic and
               social development. There are several air transport demand
               forecasting models, which differ from each other in terms of
               time, available data and the aspects to be analysed. The aim of
               this study is to create forecasts that can help government
               authorities to formulate air transport development policies. This
               paper focuses on a regional context — Sardinia — the second
               largest island in the Mediterranean. A large part of its economic
               and social development potential (tourism-related) is based on
               breaking its isolation by substantially improving air
               transportation services. In particular, the originality of these
               forecasts lies in the attempt to interpret a context
               characterised by different factors influencing the air transport
               market. Public Service Obligation (PSO) (Art. 4 RC 2408/92) was
               first imposed in Sardinia in 2002, on several domestic routes.
               Low cost companies have been operating since 2007, and some of
               them took advantage of public subsidies to develop new routes.
               During the same period, the three major Sardinian airports were
               expanded and improved. This paper provides a detailed,
               descriptive analysis of air transport demand evolution at
               Cagliari’s airport (1995–2014). Based on this analysis, several
               regression models for aggregate data have been specified and
               calibrated, distinguishing between domestic and international

               deregulation, de-integration and privatization. However, while in
               some sectors (eg. electricity, telecommunications and postal
               services) European directives played a crucial role in boosting a
               common evolutionary path, in other cases, mainly related to local
               public services, this influence remained feeble and more
               uncertain. The empirical insight on EU Local Public Transport
               Services carried out in this paper, based on 9+1 country study
               reports, aims at investigating if and to what extent this new
               dominant paradigm actually emerges, or if and to what extent more
               fragmented and heterogeneous outcomes prevail. The study,
               conducted through a common analytical grid, mainly concentrated
               on qualitative aspects (planning and governance of services,
               provider of services, process of regulation, method of funding),
               do not want to draw conclusions on the adequacy of the single
               organisational form, but mainly to investigate the ongoing trend
               in order to facilitate mutual understanding and learning. The
               emerging outcome is that the public role in Local Public
               Transport is still widespread and that a major theoretical and
               analytical focus should be directed to the ability of the
               principal-competent public administration to play its role in an
               effective and sound manner, while often too much attention is
               payed to the characterisics of the agent-operator

               electronic government projects aimed at providing electronic
               information and services to citizens and businesses. Although Web
               sites are becoming essential elements of modern public
               administration, little is known about their effectiveness. The
               objective of this paper is to study the quality and usage of
               public e-services to citizens in Europe.According to the results
               of this study, e-government seems to be following a more or less
               predictable development pattern ranging from a stage in which
               interaction is limited to what is shown on the screen to stages
               in which there is two-way communication and service and financial
               transactions can be completed with a satisfactory level of
               protection of personal privacy. At present, e-government in
               almost all the cities studied is merely an extension of the
               government, with potential benefits in speed and accessibility
               24/7. Despite the limited degree of development observed, online
               access has advantages that are impossible to replicate offline.
               Even though few expect e-government to completely replace
               traditional methods of information, e-government is becoming a
               powerful tool of transformation that has become embedded in the

                  utility sectors of many Member States of the European Union,
                  although the concept itself and the importance of PSO to the
                  national authorities and the industry vary significantly. In
                  fact there is no one precise Community definition of public
                  service obligation, what perhaps can justify differentiated
                  approach to PSO among Member States. Community secondary
                  legislation, soft law and the case law of the European Court
                  of Justice is somehow unclear in this regard, since it has
                  used public service obligation, service of general economic
                  interest and service of general interest to define the same
                  notion. Therefore in reality it is difficult to present one
                  clear concept of PSOs which would apply to all sectors of the
                  Community internal market. In general public services-most
                  typically but not exclusively network services such as
                  telecommunication, electricity, gas, transport and postal
                  services-are services of commercial character, which are
                  considered essential to the general public. For this reason
                  authorities impose public service obligations upon certain
                  undertakings to guarantee that such services are provided
                  according to the conditions specified by the authorities.
                  Moreover most PSOs are not justified in economic or business
                  terms, since they are burdened with losses. This means that
                  under normal circumstances market would be very hesitant to
                  provide them, or would not provide them at all. Therefore to
                  ensure the availability of such services national/public
                  authorities grant funding/compensation to the selected public
                  service providers under certain conditions. This on the other
                  hand raises the issue of compensation for PSOs vis-à-vis the
                  EC State aid law, which aims to prevent distortion of
                  competition by prohibiting State measures granting advantages
                  to certain undertakings that have a negative effect on
                  competition. It is thus natural to ask under what conditions
                  EC State aid law is applicable to the State funding of the
                  undertakings entrusted with the public service obligations and
                  it will be the main focus of this paper.",

                 utilities such as telecommunications, energy, public transport
                 and postal services) be subject to ordinary competition law?
                 This question has assumed great importance in the context of
                 the activities of European Union. On the one hand, it is argued
                 (particularly in France) that competition law is a threat to
                 the values of public services that underlie their distinctive
                 objectives. On the other, the 'Anglo-Saxon' argument is
                 thatprotecting public services from competition gives them an
                 unfairly protected position and can mask their inefficiencies.
                 This book examines the philosophical, political, economic, and
                 social principles involved. Prosser contrasts the mainly
                 economic and utilitarian justifications for the use of
                 competition law with rights- and citizenship-based arguments
                 for the special treatment of public services, and examines the
                 varied conceptions of the differing traditions in the UK,
                 France, and Italy. Prosser then considers the developing
                 European law in this area. He examines decisions of the
                 European Court of Justice, considers the development of the
                 concept of 'services of general interest' by the Commission,
                 and reviews the liberalization process in telecommunications,
                 energy, and postal services. He also provides a detailed
                 case-study of public service broadcasting. The book concludes
                 by drawing general principles from the debates about the extent
                 to which public services merit distinctive treatment and the
                 extent to which competition law must be amended or limited to
                 respect their distinctive roles.",

               on public services is subject to a vivid political debate. From a
               legal perspective, an important issue is the sectoral scope of
               the GATS and the exact meaning of the term 'services supplied in
               the exercise of governmental authority' in Article I:3(b) GATS.
               This paper shows that this provision is likely to be interpreted
               narrowly and that most public services will fall within the
               sectoral scope of GATS. The reason for this finding lies in the
               definition of governmental services, which emphasizes the
               non-commercial basis and non-competitive supply of a service.
               This definition distinguishes GATS law from the similar provision
               in Article 45 EC. WTO Members wishing to reduce the impact of
               GATS on public services can do so through their schedules of
               specific commitments or seek an interpretation of the GATS, which
               would give them more regulatory flexibility. Copyright Oxford

               government community service obligations, plus an incentive

               levels is proposed as essential to ensure remuneration is based
               on efficient cost levels. The paper argues that a PBC approach is
               consistent with maximising social surplus from public transport
               provision across a geographic area, for any given budget
               constraint and regulatory imposed minimum service levels. The
               main alternative, competitive tendering (CT), is argued to be
               less attractive than PBCs in terms of securing the maximum social
               surplus to the community, given the total amount of subsidy
               support available, although CT is an appropriate non-compliance
               condition. This paper is a companion to Hensher and Houghton

               transportation planning. Drawing on the literature and lessons
               from transportation planning practice, this paper describes the
               characteristics of a “communicative” form of transportation
               planning and compares them with conventional practices. A
               communicative rationality paradigm would place language and
               discourse at the core of transportation planning. The paper
               argues that it would lead to greater attention to desired
               transportation ends (goals), better integration of means and
               ends, new forms of participation and learning, and enhanced
               deliberative capacity. The paper explains the implications of
               this paradigm for the role of the transportation planner, the
               purpose of planning, the planning process, communicative
               practices, problem framing, and the nature of planning analysis.
               The paper concludes with an assessment of communicative
               rationality's ability to promote more effective transportation
               planning. It seeks to create a dialogue that will support the
               investigation of new transportation planning processes.",

  title     = "Universal service and state aid in the European union in the era
               of {NGN} (次世代ネットワーク時代におけるEUのユニバーサルサービスと国家援助) (in Japanese)",

  publisher = "Elsevier BV",
  abstract  = "This paper was authored with a Japanese audience in mind to
               explain recent developments in universal service policy and State
               aid rules for Next Generation Networks in the European Union.
               Universal service policy is intended to ensure that all members
               of society should be able to obtain a minimum level access to
               communications networks at fair and reasonable prices without
               regard to their where they live, their income level, or other
               disadvantages. Countries typically pursue universal service
               policies for communications networks because their benefit in
               terms stimulating broader economic growth outweighs the possible
               economic inefficiencies these policies can introduce. The
               on-going migration of communication networks to multi-service
               NGNs holds challenges for universal service policy. Heretofore,
               these universal service policies have been applied to traditional
               voice telecommunications networks. Given the decreasing
               importance of traditional voice telecommunications networks and
               growing adoption NGNs, industrialized nations are considering
               whether and how to apply universal service policies to broadband
               networks. Within the European Union, efforts are under way to
               address these questions such as the necessary and appropriate
               role for governments in funding universal service for NGNs. The
               rules governing State aid prohibits any form of aid which
               distorts or threatens to distort competition by favoring certain
               firms or certain goods. State aid includes, under certain
               circumstances, the public ownership of firms. The European Union
               recognizes that State aid can advance common interests and can
               remedy market failures. However, this approach also limits the
               way in which State aid can be used so as to not crowd out private
               investment. In September 2009, the European Commission published
               guidelines which established distinction between what it calls
               white, black and grey NGA areas to guide the granting of State
               aid for NGA deployment. In so-called ‘white NGA’ areas, aid
               supporting broadband network is generally permissible. In
               so-called ‘NGA grey’ and ‘NGA black’ areas, State aid is
               permissible only where the deployment where unsatisfactory or if
               there is market failure. These efforts may hold valuable lessons
               for regulators in other countries, particularly those where the
               incumbent carrier is partly publicly owned. The European Union
               approach is intended to present the least intrusive means, and as
               such it embodies the principle that desired outcome should be
               achieved with the least amount of effort possible and at the
               least possible economic cost.
               本論文では、日本の読者を対象として、次世代ネットワーク(NGN)を踏まえたEUのユニバーサルサービス・ポリシー、国家援助規則への近年の取り組みを説明する。
               ユニバーサルサービス・ポリシーは、居住地域や所得水準、その他のサービス利用上の不利な条件にかかわらず、社会に属するすべての人々が通信ネットワークへの最低限のアクセスを公平かつ妥当な料金で利用できることを目指すものである。
               いろいろな国々が、通信ネットワークに対するユニバーサルサービス・ポリシーを推進しているが、これは、経済全体の成長という観点における便益が、ポリシー適用による経済的非効率性を上回ると見られるためである。
               現在、通信ネットワークがマルチサービスのNGNに移行しつつある中で、ユニバーサルサービス・ポリシーを実現する上での問題が浮上している。
               これまでのユニバーサルサービス・ポリシーは、伝統的な音声電気通信ネットワークに適用されてきた。
               しかし現在、先進諸国は、伝統的な音声電気通信ネットワークの重要性が低下していることやNGNの導入が拡大していることを踏まえ、ブロードバンドネットワークへのユニバーサルサービス・ポリシーの適用の可否とその方策について検討し始めている。
               EUでは現在、NGNを踏まえたユニバーサルサービスに必要な資金額や適切な政府の役割などについての問題解決に向けた取り組みを進めている。
               国による支援を律する規則では、特定の企業や特定の商品によって競争をゆがめたり、競争をゆがめる恐れのある支援の仕方を禁じている。
               国家援助の中には、特定の条件の下での、企業の国有化も含まれる。
               EUでは、国家援助は共通の利益を向上させることができるとともに、市場の失敗を補うことができるものと考えられている。
               他方、国家援助は民間投資を阻害しかねない側面も持っている。
               2009年9月、欧州委員会は、次世代アクセスネットワーク(NGA)普及に対する国家援助を導入するに当たって、白/黒/グレーNGAを区分するためのガイドラインを公表した。
               「NGA白」エリアでは、ブロードバンドネットワークに対する援助が一般に認められ、「NGAグレー」エリアや「NGA黒」エリアでは普及が不満足であったり、市場の失敗がある場合にのみ、援助が適用されることとなっている。
               他の国々、特に既存事業者が部分的に国有化されている国の規制当局は、 これらの取り組みから多くを学ぶことができる。
               EUのアプローチは、介入を最小限に抑えることを意図しており、最小限の援助と経済費用によって目的を達成すべきであるという原則を具体化したものである。",

               issues surrounding the GATS. There are two approaches to
               distinguish such services from any other services: an
               institutional approach that focuses on the legal and
               institutional conditions governing supply (e.g. ownership status,
               market organisation), and a functional approach based on the
               policy objectives that may be involved (e.g. distributional and
               quality-related considerations, concepts of universal access).
               Given the wide range of institutional arrangements that exist in
               different jurisdictions, with significant variations over time,
               the former approach does not appear appropriate. The services
               provided by government-owned facilities, whose costs are covered
               directly by the State, may well be indistinguishable, for all
               practical purposes, from the services provided by private
               commercial operators, whose users (students, patients,
               passengers, etc.) are reimbursed. This paper discusses the
               relevance of the GATS for different organisational settings -
               from government monopolies to regulated and/or subsidized private
               provision - that may be used by WTO Members to meet typical
               public service objectives. It turns out that virtually all forms
               of organisation can be accommodated within the framework of the
               Agreement. To fully exploit its opportunities and avoid
               unpleasant surprises, however, governments would need to
               thoroughly analyse the relevant provisions in the light of their

                 imposition of Public Service Obligations (PSO) on certain
                 routes may affect the transportation sector, with a focus on
                 aviation in the European Single Market. Thus, this research
                 investigates how this form of public intervention can be useful
                 to access adequeate transport system in remote and peripherical
                 regions. Subsequently, this paper intends to display that the
                 imposition of PSO on aviation routes should be considered as a
                 unique mean of market intervention on behalf of territorial
                 cohesion. To accomplish this, an analysis of the economic
                 impact in terms of efficiency and sustainability in the case of
                 the scheduled air route between Almeria and Seville in addition
                 to other transportation alternatives such the bus or train was
                 conducted. Additionally, this research attempts to shift the
                 research focus away from PSO routes in order to determine the
                 convenience of administrative concession as a way to foster the
                 creation of specific routes, which furthermore cannot be
                 covered by the entrepreneurship of private initiative in a free
                 market regime. Consequently, this approach recognises that this

               inclusion of broadband in scope of Universal Service are
               presented. Based on the EU commission approach, we discussed
               models for broadband deployment and their decomposition. The aim
               of these models is to identify the main access gaps and the scope
               of services to be considered. The proposed model gives possible
               intervention methods. Financial scheme based on public private
               partnership is emphasized. The paper proposes that the broadband

  abstract  = "Section 254(b)(3) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act established
               the objective that residents of rural areas should have access to
               advanced telecommunications and information services comparable
               to services in urban areas. Pursuant to the passage of the Act,
               the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established a new
               universal fund that provides explicit support to high-cost rural
               areas. This paper addresses the question of whether people in
               rural areas have similar access due to the support provided
               through the Commission's new high-cost fund. This paper focuses
               on the telephone platform because cable companies often do not
               serve rural areas due to the high cost of service, and because
               there is no mechanism for the federal or state government to
               subsidize the provision of advanced telecommunications services
               via cable. The Act's objectives are apparently not being met in
               rural areas served by large companies since people living in
               these areas are much less likely to have qualified lines that
               could be used to access advanced telecommunications services. On
               the other hand, small companies are much closer to satisfying the
               statutory requirement as a result of the implicit support
               received through cost sharing.",

               an informed social science perspective based on research that
               will enhance theoretical understandings and policy formulations.
               Beginning with a focus on changes in the nature of demand for
               transportation and its supply, the discussion considers issues
               relating to regional inequalities in accessibility,
               standardization for multimodal transport, and governance of
               global transportation. The vulnerability of transport-dependent

               partnerships throughout the world is a good illustration of this
               trend. In order to foster competition, competitive tendering
               through the use of auctions is now common. Nevertheless,

               the French and the London models of urban public transport. Few
               competitors and collusive behaviours, with increasing costs,
               characterize the French model, while the London model, as far as
               we have seen, exhibits better results, by using the transparency
               of auction procedures and the discretionary power of the

               stages during which planning options are drawn up and the public
               are rarely involved. The AHP makes it possible to consider the
               multiple objectives of decision makers and allows public
               engagement to be deliberative, participatory, dynamic and
               flexible, which is independent of planning options. The method
               was specified and calibrated starting from a specific stated
               preferences survey, and its parameters were calibrated with
               respect to two scenarios: without any transport options and with
               real transport options. Different criteria (accessibility, travel

               The resulting divide has produced many heated debates; however,

               Administration examines the intellectual origins and identity of

               transport in Japan is in a difficult situation because of
               operating deficits, inefficient operations and management, and
               budgetary constraints of expanding subsidies, and thus, it needs
               to be restructured to improve efficiency. This paper investigates
               the impact of subsidies and contractual settings on the cost
               structure of the publicly-owned bus sector in Japan. A trans-log
               cost function has been estimated by pooling cross-sectional data
               of 527 observations over the time period of 1990–2006 for a
               cross-section of 31 publicly-owned transport companies in Japan.
               Our analytical results confirm that governmental subsidies to
               this sector negatively affect the cost structure, while the
               contractual model may have a positive impact. We also discuss the
               implications of these results for Japan’s public transport

               addition subsidies increase output, regulations decrease output

               politics, a field that I had, until then, not examined in any
               detail. Given my background studying social movements and
               political institutions, I was intrigued by the ‘career’ of the
               environmental movement. In twenty years, it had transformed from
               a counter-cultural movement, practising the symbolic politics of
               street demonstrations, lifestyle choices, and alternative
               consumption (expressed in an elaborate and very visible urban
               circuit encompassing bookshops, wholemeal food stores, dress
               codes, communal households, and so on) to a more mainstream
               political force, seeking representation and influence through
               ‘green’ parties and professional lobbying (see Hajer, 1995). Upon
               reflection, it seemed obvious that much more was going on in
               environmental politics than fighting ‘environmental degradation’.
               The differences in style, both in terms of ways of life and of
               conducting politics, signalled that environmental politics was in
               fact a field of profound ‘cultural politics’. Environmental
               politics appeared to be a stage at which society reflected on its
               record: values were at risk, moral commitments were contested and
               the very form of conducting politics was questioned (Hajer,
               1996).",

               1986 established the Smoking Research Foundation (SRF), a
               research-funding institution, and to explore the extent to which
               SRF has influenced science and health policy in Japan. METHODS:
               We analysed documents in the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents
               archive, along with recent Japanese litigation documents and
               published documents. RESULTS: JT's effort to combat effective
               tobacco control was strengthened in the mid-1980s, following
               privatisation of the company. While remaining under the
               protection of Japan's Ministry of Finance, the semiprivatised
               company lost its 'access to politicos', opening up a perceived
               need for collaboration with global cigarette makers. One
               solution, arrived at through clandestine planning with American
               companies, was to establish a third-party organisation, SRF, with
               the hope of capturing scientific and medical authority for the
               industry. Guarded by powerful people in government and academia,
               SRF was launched with the covert goal of influencing tobacco
               policy both inside and outside Japan. Scholars funded by SRF have
               participated in international conferences, national advisory
               committees and tobacco litigation, in most instances helping the
               industry to maintain a favourable climate for the continued sale
               of cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to industry claims, SRF was
               never meant to be independent or neutral. With active support
               from foreign cigarette manufacturers, SRF represents the
               expansion into Asia of the denialist campaign that began in the
               USA in 1953.",

               significant growth, leading to an uptick in clinical trials
               conducted by contract research organizations (CROs). Research
               focusing on CRO-managed trials and the communication of trial
               outcomes to the consumer market remains underexplored. This
               metaepidemiological study aims to evaluate the quality of
               randomized controlled trials (RCTs) facilitated by prominent CROs
               in Japan and to examine the quality of the representations used
               to convey their results to consumers. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:
               This study focused on the food trials that were registered in the
               University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial
               Registry or the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
               by the top 5 CROs. Press releases of study results or
               advertisements of food products based on the study results were
               identified by conducting a Google search. The risk of bias in the
               RCT publications was independently assessed by 2 reviewers, who
               also evaluated the presence of ``spin'' in the abstracts and full
               texts. An assessment of ``spin'' in press releases/advertisements
               was undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 76 RCT registrations, 32 RCT
               publications, and 11 press releases/advertisements were included.
               Approximately 72\% of the RCT publications exhibited a high risk
               of bias due to selective outcome reporting. ``Spin'' was present
               in the results of the abstract (72\%), abstract conclusion
               (81\%), full-text results (44\%), and full-text conclusion
               (84\%). ``Spin'' appeared in 73\% of press
               releases/advertisements due to the selective outcome reporting.
               CONCLUSION: Functional food presentations in Japan frequently
               contained ``spin.'' The Japanese government should more
               rigorously check whether food manufacturers report outcomes
               selectively.",

  abstract  = "In this paper we focus on the development of a new service model
               for accessing transport, namely Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and
               present one of the first critical analyses of the rhetoric
               surrounding the concept. One central assumption of one prevalent
               MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled
               into service packages for monthly payment, as in the
               telecommunication or media service sectors. Various other forms
               of MaaS are being developed but all tend to offer door-to-door
               multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms
               connecting users and service operators. By drawing on literature
               concerned with socio-technical transitions, we address two
               multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS
               promises (to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the
               unanticipated societal implications that could arise from a
               wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as
               wellbeing, emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de
               facto challenges for urban governance if the packaged services
               model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended
               responses? To address these questions, we begin by considering
               the evolution of intelligent transport systems that underpin the
               current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model
               could provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then
               identify a set of plausible unanticipated societal effects that
               have implications for urban planning and transport governance.
               This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive
               rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand promises about efficiency,
               choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible
               unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public
               intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons of both efficiency and
               equity.",

               development is happening across sectoral, multi-layered, and
               multi-actor networks. Previous case studies on understanding
               networked governance of MaaS inform us that there is a range of
               challenges in the current institutional arrangements, lack of
               shared MaaS vision, divergent interests, and even conflicts over
               roles and responsibilities. These case studies have used
               analytical frameworks based on socio-technical transitions
               theory, complemented with theories from institutional and
               business studies. This study focuses on Finland, aiming to
               provide additional insights about perspectives of non-commercial
               actors. In particular, we provide a more sophisticated
               understanding of underlying reasons for conflict and lack of
               cooperation concerning an understanding of MaaS, its
               implications, and associated governance actions. The applied

               findings from seventeen non-commercial organisations have been
               classified into five categories, namely definitions, operational

               increasing interest across the world. First studies and field
               trials in developed cities suggest that MaaS can influence
               people’s mobility behavior and create more sustainable transport
               systems. However, many findings are not transferable to the
               Global South context, considering that in terms of transport
               infrastructure, institutional setups, and citizens’ preferences,
               most developing cities present significantly different
               characteristics. Thus, many critical questions remain unanswered,
               e.g., ‘How to implement MaaS in a developing context?’, ‘What are
               the main challenges?’, and ‘Who should lead this development?’.
               This research work considers a public-pushed development and aims
               to shed light on barriers that transport authorities might face.
               First, barriers are identified through a literature review at the
               intersection of transport research and public sector innovation.
               Second, the barriers are analyzed based on the technology,
               organization, and environment (TOE) framework. Third, Global
               South relevance is determined through a two-round expert survey.
               Data related issues (e.g., standardized open data) have been
               identified as the most critical barrier. Also, multimodal
               transport planning and coordinating intermodal trips seem to be
               crucial challenges, considering highly fragmented operator
               landscapes and the lack of integrated transport planning
               approaches. In addition, auto-centric developments, current
               institutional setups, and transport authorities’ organizational
               structures could hamper a MaaS transition in the Global South.
               This article contributes to the emerging literature on MaaS
               governance and provides insights on the capabilities of

               technology undoubtedly plays an important role in the development
               of MaaS schemes, coordinating the various stakeholders, from
               different levels of decision-making, seems to be an equally, if
               not even greater challenge. Building on a case study that focused
               on the development of the very first MaaS commercial solution in
               the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, this paper uses the multi-level
               governance (MLG) analytical framework to discuss which governance
               mechanisms are most likely to support the full realization of the
               MaaS potential. Findings indicate that while Type II governance
               processes (horizontal development of a MaaS network, unfolding of
               several MaaS initiatives in parallel, informal lobbying from
               local government) undoubtedly played a role in the emergence of
               the solution, it is mainly thanks to Type I mechanisms (strong
               visions from public authorities, development of a dedicated
               legislation) that MaaS could finally move forward in the Finnish
               capital region, and exit the institutional dead-end in which it
               was trapped. By shedding light on the governance of
               Mobility-as-a-Service, this paper contributes to the growing MaaS
               literature that has paid so far little attention to the nuts and
               bolts of MaaS development, and contributes in further using the
               MLG in transport studies. The paper ultimately concludes by
               highlighting the need to conduct more research on the governance
               of MaaS in order to ultimately develop a more holistic
               understanding of the role that public authorities are playing in

               developments. A potential action, which has received a lot of
               attention, is to introduce Intermediary MaaS Integrators; that is
               intermediate actors that assemble the offerings from Transport
               Service Providers (TSPs) and distribute these to MaaS Operators.
               However, little is known about if and how TSPs and MaaS Operators
               would appreciate the introduction of Intermediary MaaS
               Integrators. To address this knowledge gap, this paper explores
               an attempt to establish a national Intermediary MaaS Integrator
               in Sweden. The contribution to transportation research is
               twofold. Firstly, the paper advances the conceptual understanding
               of Intermediary MaaS Integrators by identifying four defining
               dimensions: Activities, Management, Processes and Context.
               Secondly, it deepens the knowledge of Intermediary MaaS
               Integrators’ value propositions by detailing TSPs’ and
               prospective MaaS Operators’ hopes and fears vis-à-vis them.
               Lastly, practical implications for how to facilitate acceptance
               and adoption are proposed. Intermediary MaaS Integrators should
               only be introduced if basic incentives for using their services
               are in place, and if introduced, they should preferably: go
               beyond offering technical services; have clear, declared
               objectives; be impartial and capable actors; and carefully

                 improving public health by using digitalization, especially in
                 prevention and health promotion. The first step toward a better
                 understanding of digital public health is to conceptualize the
                 subject of the assessment by defining what digital public
                 health interventions are. This is important, as one cannot
                 evaluate tools if one does not know what precisely an
                 intervention in this field can be. Therefore, this study aims
                 to provide the first definition of digital public health
                 interventions. We will merge leading models for public health
                 functions by the World Health Organization, a framework for
                 digital health technologies by the National Institute for
                 Health and Care Excellence, and a user-centered approach to
                 intervention development. Together, they provide an overview of
                 the functions and areas of use for digital public health
                 interventions. Nevertheless, one must keep in mind that public
                 health functions can differ among different health care
                 systems, limiting our new framework's universal validity. We
                 conclude that a digital public health intervention should
                 address essential public health functions through digital
                 means. Furthermore, it should include members of the target

               successful, different suppliers of transport services have to
               cooperate in alliances in order to bring new benefits in the
               short and long term. Past experience demonstrates that this is a
               challenge, and existing transport providers are struggling with
               this cooperation. Various factors, including divergent interests
               of stakeholders, may limit the formation of such alliances. In
               this paper, we resort to the theories of alliance formation to
               extend our understanding of the formation of alliances within
               MaaS. Based on the economic, sociological and business literature
               we propose a conceptual model and formulate ten fundamental
               propositions for alliance formation to offer MaaS systems. The
               model takes the perspective of business firms for whom the
               institutional environment is an exogenous influence. We then
               apply this conceptual alliance-formation-model for a MaaS-pilot
               in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Stakeholders within this pilot were
               interviewed on their conditions for forming an alliance. It
               appears that shared goals, limited risks for the partners
               involved, trust, and stimulating public actions are crucial for a
               successful alliance. For the pilot, however, learning appears to
               be the main motive for the firms to get involved. For future
               transition from the exploration to the exploitation phase of MaaS
               alliance, these results should be taken into account. The

  abstract  = "How do we regulate a changing technology, with changing uses, in
               a changing world? This chapter argues that while existing
               (inter)national AI governance approaches are important, they are
               often siloed. Technology-centric approaches focus on individual
               AI applications; law-centric approaches emphasize AI’s effects on
               pre-existing legal fields or doctrines. This chapter argues that
               to foster a more systematic, functional and effective AI
               regulatory ecosystem, policy actors should instead complement
               these approaches with a regulatory perspective that emphasizes
               how, when, and why AI applications enable patterns of
               ‘sociotechnical change’. Drawing on theories from the emerging
               field of ‘TechLaw’, it explores how this perspective can provide
               informed, more nuanced, and actionable perspectives on AI
               regulation. A focus on sociotechnical change can help analyze
               when and why AI applications actually do create a meaningful
               rationale for new regulation — and how they are consequently best
               approached as targets for regulatory intervention, considering
               not just the technology, but also six distinct ‘problem logics’
               that appear around AI issues across domains. The chapter
               concludes by briefly reviewing concrete institutional and
               regulatory actions that can draw on this approach in order to
               improve the regulatory triage, tailoring, timing \&

               providing more sustainable urban transportation. Decades of
               car-centric developments have led to congestion and air
               pollution. Therefore, it is vital to shift to public
               transportation and other greener modes. Efforts to enable this
               shift are underway, including multimodal transportation
               information systems. More recent trends include ride-sharing
               platforms and travel-broker services. MaaS holds the promise of
               unifying these services and providing a single platform for
               information, booking, and payment for all modes of
               transportation, potentially as a subscription model. However, if
               the MaaS concept is not checked by regulators, it could also have
               negative effects, such as increased inequality or a shift away
               from conventional public transportation to (single occupancy)
               e-hailing. Policy-makers must respond to, and guide
               implementation toward, maximum public good. Four distinctive case
               studies were analyzed to give recommendations for the role of
               public authorities. Recommendations include developing a balanced
               governance model with clear key performance indicators (KPIs),
               careful consideration of evolving urban mobility and
               corresponding legislation and funding, and the need for a robust

                   models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
                   (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market, focusing on the increased
                   capabilities arising from LLM-powered software compared to
                   LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations
                   based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating
                   both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings
                   reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at
                   least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction
                   of LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least
                   50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions
                   about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The
                   projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income
                   jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities
                   and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are
                   not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity
                   growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM,
                   about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed
                   significantly faster at the same level of quality. When
                   incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this
                   share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This
                   finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a
                   substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the
                   underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit
                   traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they
                   could have considerable economic, social, and policy

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: There has been a proliferation of frameworks with a
               common goal of bridging the gap between evidence, policy, and
               practice, but few aim to specifically guide evaluations of
               academic-policy engagement. We present the modification of an
               action framework for the purpose of selecting, developing and
               evaluating interventions for academic-policy engagement. METHODS:
               We build on the conceptual work of an existing framework known as
               SPIRIT (Supporting Policy In Health with Research: an
               Intervention Trial), developed for the evaluation of strategies
               intended to increase the use of research in health policy. Our
               aim was to modify SPIRIT, (i) to be applicable beyond health
               policy contexts, for example encompassing social, environmental,
               and economic policy impacts and (ii) to address broader dynamics
               of academic-policy engagement. We used an iterative approach
               through literature reviews and consultation with multiple
               stakeholders from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and policy
               professionals working at different levels of government and
               across geographical contexts in England, alongside our evaluation
               activities in the Capabilities in Academic Policy Engagement
               (CAPE) programme. RESULTS: Our modifications expand upon Redman
               et al.'s original framework, for example adding a domain of
               'Impacts and Sustainability' to capture continued activities
               required in the achievement of desirable outcomes. The modified
               framework fulfils the criteria for a useful action framework,
               having a clear purpose, being informed by existing
               understandings, being capable of guiding targeted interventions,
               and providing a structure to build further knowledge. CONCLUSION:
               The modified SPIRIT framework is designed to be meaningful and
               accessible for people working across varied contexts in the
               evidence-policy ecosystem. It has potential applications in how
               academic-policy engagement interventions might be developed,
               evaluated, facilitated and improved, to ultimately support the
               use of evidence in decision-making.",

               public and private organizations are so great that business
               practices should not be transferred to the public sector. In this
               paper the theoretical arguments on the differences between
               private firms and public agencies are reviewed, and 13 hypotheses
               are identified on the impact of publicness on organizational
               environments, goals, structures and managerial values. Evidence
               from 34 empirical studies of differences between public agencies
               and private firms is critically evaluated. Only three of the
               publicness hypotheses are supported by a majority of the
               empirical studies: public organizations are more bureaucratic,
               and public managers are less materialistic and have weaker
               organizational commitment than their private sector counterparts.
               However, most of the statistical evidence is derived from studies
               that use narrow measures of publicness and fail to control for
               other relevant explanatory variables. Whether the existing
               evidence understates or overstates the distinctiveness of public
               agencies is therefore unclear. A research agenda and methods are
               identified for better comparisons of management in public and

                 psychology on the behavior of individuals and groups. The
                 authors discuss how scholars in public administration currently
                 draw on theories and methods from psychology and related fields
                 and point to research in public administration that could
                 benefit from further integration. An analysis of public
                 administration topics through a psychological lens can be
                 useful to confirm, add nuance to, or extend classical public
                 administration theories. As such, behavioral public
                 administration complements traditional public administration.
                 Furthermore, it could be a two‐way street for psychologists who
                 want to test the external validity of their theories in a
                 political‐administrative setting. Finally, four principles are

               organizational change was founded on themes of disaggregation,
               competition, and incentivization. Although its effects are still
               working through in countries new to NPM, this wave has now
               largely stalled or been reversed in some key ``leading-edge''
               countries. This ebbing chiefly reflects the cumulation of adverse
               indirect effects on citizens' capacities for solving social
               problems because NPM has radically increased institutional and
               policy complexity. The character of the post-NPM regime is
               currently being formed. We set out the case that a range of
               connected and information technology-centered changes will be
               critical for the current and next wave of change, and we focus on
               themes of reintegration, needs-based holism, and digitization
               changes. The overall movement incorporating these new shifts is
               toward ``digital-era governance'' (DEG), which involves
               reintegrating functions into the governmental sphere, adopting
               holistic and needs-oriented structures, and progressing
               digitalization of administrative processes. DEG offers a perhaps
               unique opportunity to create self-sustaining change, in a broad
               range of closely connected technological, organizational,
               cultural, and social effects. But there are alternative scenarios
               as to how far DEG will be recognized as a coherent phenomenon and

               For over two decades, Dillman's classic text on survey design has
               aided both students and professionals in effectively planning and
               conducting mail, telephone, and, more recently, Internet surveys.
               The new edition is thoroughly updated and revised, and covers all
               aspects of survey research. It features expanded coverage of
               mobile phones, tablets, and the use of do-it-yourself surveys,
               and Dillman's unique Tailored Design Method is also thoroughly
               explained. This invaluable resource is crucial for any researcher
               seeking to increase response rates and obtain high-quality
               feedback from survey questions. Consistent with current emphasis
               on the visual and aural, the new edition is complemented by
               copious examples within the text and accompanying website. This
               heavily revised Fourth Edition includes: Strategies and tactics
               for determining the needs of a given survey, how to design it,
               and how to effectively administer it How and when to use mail,
               telephone, and Internet surveys to maximum advantage Proven
               techniques to increase response rates Guidance on how to obtain
               high-quality feedback from mail, electronic, and other
               self-administered surveys Direction on how to construct effective
               questionnaires, including considerations of layout The effects of
               sponsorship on the response rates of surveys Use of capabilities
               provided by newly mass-used media: interactivity, presentation of
               aural and visual stimuli. The Fourth Edition reintroduces the
               telephone—including coordinating land and mobile. Grounded in the

  abstract  = "Given the innovative nature of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS),
               various uncertainties are surrounding the possibilities for
               implementing MaaS. This includes uncertainties about alternative
               MaaS-system functionalities, about how the implementation of
               alternative MaaS systems might affect the overall transport
               system performance and about the preferences of stakeholders
               regarding alternative MaaS system implementation strategies. This
               paper contributes to this niche by collecting expert opinions
               about these uncertainties, using the Delphi method. The expert
               panel expected a fully-integrated MaaS to start operating in
               urban areas before 2020 and to expand to rural areas and
               nationally within the period of 2020–2030. In contrast to the
               common expectation that MaaS will attract regular car driver from
               their vehicles, our panel expected youth, current public
               transport users, and flexible travellers to be early adopters of
               MaaS. Transport operators are seen as the most important actors
               and the most preferred MaaS service integrator. Local authorities
               are expected to have an important role in enabling MaaS. The main
               objectives for implementing MaaS are to reduce car dependency and
               to provide a flexible and more customised transport system
               accessibility to the general public. The implementation of MaaS
               as a pilot project is considered the most preferred policy in the
               next phase. These findings largely support earlier reported
               findings on MaaS implementation. This study report new findings
               regarding the levels of consensus and how the experts changed
               their individual opinions in light of the group results on the
               studied topics. Regarding certain topics, such as the early
               market, there are higher levels of agreements among the panel
               with lower proportions of them changing their selections in light
               of the group results. Whereas in other topics, such as planning
               for future implementation, the level of agreement are lower with
               higher proportions of experts changing their selections. These
               two attributes can be combined to infer how certain the panel is
               on the topics studied. The study also provides new insights into
               the possible vulnerabilities and opportunities that can arise in
               relation to MaaS implementation, the associated levels of
               importance and uncertainty, and the possible responding actions.
               The experts also identified potential social issues and
               challenges in scaling-up the pilot. The findings of this study
               are of interest to practitioners and researchers in the field of
               MaaS planning and can be used to initiate a discussion among
               actors and stakeholders to formulate implementation plans for
               different MaaS concepts.",

               supply-side analysis, and designing business model. Finally, we

               exacerbated by the pandemic and the rise of social media, have
               not been fully elucidated. This study, using Japanese Twitter
               data, revealed that (a) anti-vaxxers are characterized by high
               political interest, (b) persistent anti-vaxxers were more
               ideologically left-leaning and had stronger ties to existing
               political parties, and (c) pandemic-induced new anti-vaxxers
               displayed low political engagement but a greater affinity for
               conspiracy theories, spirituality, naturalism, and alternative
               health practices, which served as gateways to anti-vaccination
               views. Furthermore, those who turned anti-vaccine after the
               pandemic also exhibited an increased tendency to follow the newly
               emerged anti-vaccine party, potentially contributing to their
               political representation at the national level. These analyses
               show that the anti-vaccine discourse has expanded and reached a
               politically representative scale, strengthening its discursive

               counts as evidence and which factors influence these perceptions
               (for example, professional background, length of service,
               organisation setting, cultures of evidence)? In addressing this
               question, we contribute to the growing research focus on the
               context of evidence use. Q methodology – a mixed method approach
               to study people’s attitudes towards a topic – is used in
               interviewing 67 policy actors and comparing two countries,
               Scotland and Wales, to find out whether there are different
               cultures of evidence. In both countries, we identified four
               distinct profiles of attitudes towards evidence: the
               evidence-based policymaking (EBPM) Idealist, the Pragmatist, the
               Inclusive, and the Political. Our research highlights important
               differences between the two contexts, with a greater leaning
               towards EBPM views of evidence in Wales, and more pragmatism in
               defining evidence in Scotland. We illustrate how different

                 (ii) Mainstream approaches focus on the interaction of policy
                 actors in policymaking. (iii) Interpretive approaches examine
                 the framing and representation of problems and how policies
                 reflect the social construction of 'problems'. Policy analysis
                 may assist understanding of how and why policies to improve
                 nutrition are enacted (or rejected) and may inform
                 practitioners in their advocacy. As such, policy analysis
                 provides researchers with a powerful tool to understand the use
                 of research evidence in policymaking and generate a heightened
                 understanding of the values, interests and political contexts
                 underpinning policy decisions. Such methods may enable more
                 effective advocacy for policies that can lead to improvements

  abstract  = "Abstract:Evidence‐based policy‐making represents a contemporary
               effort to reform or re‐structure policy processes in order to
               prioritize evidentiary or data‐based decision‐making. Like
               earlier efforts in the “policy analysis movement,” its aim is to
               avoid or minimize policy failures caused by a mismatch between
               government expectations and actual, on‐the‐ground conditions
               through the provision of greater amounts of policy‐relevant
               information. A significant factor affecting the ability of
               policy‐makers to engage in evidence‐based policy‐making pertains
               to both governmental and non‐governmental “policy analytical
               capacity.” That is, governments require a reasonably high level
               of policy analytical capacity to perform the tasks associated
               with managing the policy process in order to implement
               evidence‐based policy‐making and avoid several of the most common
               sources of policy failures. Recent studies, however, suggest
               that, even in advanced countries such as Canada, the level of
               policy analytical capacity found in many governments and
               non‐governmental actors is low, potentially contributing to both
               a failure of evidence‐based policy‐making as well as effectively
               dealing with many complex contemporary policy
               challenges.Sommaire:L'élaboration de politiques axée sur des
               éléments probants représente un effort contemporain de réforme ou
               de structuration des processus de politiques dans le but de
               donner la prioritéà la prise de décisions s'appuyant sur les
               preuves ou fondée sur les données. Comme pour les efforts
               antérieurs du « mouvement d'analyse de politiques », le but est
               d'éviter ou de minimiser les échecs de politiques causés par un
               décalage entre les attentes du gouvernement et les conditions
               réelles sur le terrain, grâce à la disposition de plus amples
               informations pertinentes aux politiques. Un facteur important
               touchant à l'aptitude des élaborateurs de politiques à s'engager
               dans une élaboration de politiques axée sur les éléments probants
               est liéà la « capacité d'analyse de politiques » aussi bien
               gouvernementale que non gouvernementale. C'est‐à‐dire que les
               gouvernements exigent un niveau raisonnablement élevé de capacité
               d'analyse de politiques en vue d'exécuter les tâches associées à
               la gestion du processus politique pour mettre en œuvre
               l'élaboration de politiques axée sur les éléments probants et
               éviter ainsi plusieurs sources courantes d'échecs de politiques.
               Néanmoins, des études récentes laissent entendre que, même dans
               les pays développés comme le Canada, le niveau de capacité
               d'analyse de politiques observé dans de nombreux gouvernements et
               chez un grand nombre d'acteurs non gouvernementaux est faible ;
               cela pourrait éventuellement contribuer à la fois à un échec de
               l'élaboration de politiques axées sur les éléments probants ainsi
               qu'à l'échec de régler efficacement de nombreux problèmes
               contemporains complexes en matière de politiques.",

  abstract  = "Social and territorial structures form intricate relations that
               transcend a social stratification or spatial focus. Territorial
               features and geographic displacements are structuring principles
               for society, as societal features and social change effect the
               structure and use of territory. Based on our examination of the
               conceptual and theoretical links between spatial and social
               mobility, we propose a concept that represents a new form of
               inequality. Termed ‘motility’, this construct describes the
               potential and actual capacity of goods, information or people to
               be mobile both geographically and socially. Three major features
               of motility — access, competence and appropriation — are
               introduced. In this article, we focus on conceptual and
               theoretical contributions of motility. In addition, we suggest a
               number of possible empirical investigations. Motility presents us
               with an innovative perspective on societal changes without
               prematurely committing researchers to work within structuralist
               or postmodern perspectives. More generally, we propose to revisit
               the fluidification debate in the social sciences with a battery
               of questions that do not begin and end with whether or not
               society is in flux. Instead, we introduce a field of research
               that takes advantage of the insights from competing paradigms in
               order to reveal the social dynamics and consequences of
               displacements in geographic and social space.Les structures
               sociales et territoriales forment des relations complexes qui
               dépassent toute stratification sociale ou convergence spatiale.
               Les caractéristiques territoriales et déplacements géographiques
               sont, pour la société, des principes structurants, tout comme les
               caractéristiques sociétales et le changement social font naître
               la structure et l'usage d'un territoire. A partir d'un examen des
               liens conceptuels et théoriques entre les mobilités spatiale et
               sociale, cet article propose un concept traduisant une nouvelle
               forme d'inégalité: appelé‘motilité’, il décrit le potentiel et
               l'aptitude réelle des marchandises, informations ou individus
               àêtre mobiles sur un plan tant géographique que social. Trois
               traits essentiels de la motilité— accès, compétence et
               appropriation — sont présentés. Si l'article s'attache aux
               contributions conceptuelles et théoriques de la motilité, il
               suggère aussi plusieurs axes possibles d'études empiriques. La
               motilité offre une perspective novatrice sur les changements
               sociétaux, sans engager prématurément les travaux de recherches
               sur des rails structuralistes ou post‐modernes. Plus
               généralement, il s'agit de revisiter le débat sur la
               fluidification en sciences sociales à l'aide d'une batterie de
               questions qui, ni au début ni à la fin, ne demande si la société
               est fluctuante ou non. En revanche, l'article propose un domaine
               de recherches qui exploite les réflexions tirées de paradigmes
               concurrents afin de révéler la dynamique sociale et les
               conséquences des déplacements dans l'espace géographique et

  abstract  = "AbstractPrebiotic chemical evolution and the emergence of life in
               the seafloor hydrothermal systems of Hadean Earth is among the
               most plausible and popular hypotheses for the origin of earthly
               life. In contrast, many studies pointed out that this hypothesis
               intrinsically harbors a critical unsolved problem called the
               “water paradox”: Abundant water limits dehydration synthesis and
               instead facilitates hydrolysis of organic molecules during the
               early stage of chemical evolution. However, many of these
               criticisms have not referred to the abundant liquid/supercritical
               CO2 (L/SC-CO2) fluids and pools in modern hydrothermal systems,
               which not only create dry environments but also behave as
               hydrophobic solvents at and beneath the seafloor. In this paper,
               we theorize the generation and preservation of a L/SC-CO2 pool in
               modern seafloor hydrothermal systems and reinterpret the fossil
               hydrothermal systems preserved in early Archean seafloor basalts.
               The theoretical estimation of subseafloor phase separation and
               phase segregation of CO2-rich hydrothermal fluids suggests the
               presence of L/SC-CO2 fluids and pools in Hadean seafloor
               hydrothermal systems. Because they behave as hydrophobic organic
               solvents, L/SC-CO2 can potentially initiate the dehydration
               synthesis of organic molecules in seafloor hydrothermal systems.
               Moreover, at the interface between L/SC-CO2 and H2O-rich fluid
               (seawater or hydrothermal fluid), amphiphilic molecules might be
               generated and triggered into self-assembled growth. Based on the
               abundant occurrence and physicochemical properties of L/SC-CO2
               fluids, we propose a new stepwise concept for the origin of life,
               whereby prebiotic chemical evolution was co-hosted and
               facilitated by L/SC-CO2 in Hadean water-rich seafloor
               hydrothermal systems. This “liquid/supercritical CO2 hypothesis”
               potentially overcomes the water paradox and strengthens the idea
               that earthly life was hatched in deep-sea hydrothermal systems.",

                 science between ‘positive’ and ‘normative’ political theory,
                 particularly the belief that formal and mathematical methods
                 are only pertinent to positive political theory. We argue that
                 formal models are equally valuable in normative political
                 theory for three reasons: they can make thought experiments
                 more rigorous, they can demonstrate the consistency of
                 normative principles, and they can provide insights into the
                 practical workings of novel institutional arrangements in the
                 absence of empirical data. The integration of formal models
                 into normative political theory presents challenges, including
                 the development of criteria for evaluating these models and
                 potential shifts in research focus. Integration can also
                 strengthen political theory’s tenuous role in the political

               citizens' representations thanks to their ability to combine
               meanings and to stimulate emotional reactions. We use crisis
               management as a lens through which we analyse this symbolic
               dimension, and we focus on two case studies (governmental
               responses to the Covid-19 crisis in Europe in 2020 and to
               terrorist attacks in France in 2015). We show how the symbolic
               enables leaders to claim legitimacy for themselves and their
               decisions, and foster feelings of reassurance, solidarity and
               belonging. All politicians use the symbolic, whether consciously
               or otherwise, but what they choose to do varies and is affected
               by timing, the existence of national repertoires of symbolic
               actions and the personas of leaders.",

  abstract  = "The phenomenon of broadband penetration growth which could be
               observed over time has increased year by year. Today, broadband
               is increasingly becoming an issue for universal service in
               advanced economies. Switzerland has been the first country to
               include broadband connections as part of the universal service
               obligation, since 1 January, 2008, although at modest speeds, and
               with some exceptions. In the United States, the Federal-State
               Joint Board on Universal Service has urged the FCC to consider
               including broadband as part of universal service. In Europe, ,
               the recent EC communication on universal service specifically
               suggests for the European Union to analyse and discuss broadband
               as part of the future universal service obligation. In many OECD
               countries there have also been targeted broadband support
               programmes for rural and disadvantaged areas for a number of
               years. The list could be made quite long, and includes countries
               such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Turkey, Czech Republic,
               Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Scotland, Spain, the United States, and
               many more. These programmes have typically involved support for
               construction of broadband infrastructure, either as direct state
               aid or as partial contributions from applicable universal service
               funds. The growing number of targeted broadband support programs
               raises the question if and when it will be possible to expand
               broadband into a universal service obligation (USO). Against this
               back-drop, this paper will provide an overview of current state
               and trends of universal service with focus on broadband access in
               European Union. First the paper will provide a brief market
               overview of broadband, and also briefly define the USO concept.
               The paper will then provide an historical overview of the
               universal service concept in the European legislation, with
               particular attention to early initiatives and discussions related
               to the implementation of a possible B-USO. The paper will
               emphasize that the current discussion on a future B-USO has long
               standing antecedents, running back to the 1987 Green Paper. The
               paper will moreover analyze the previous USO review, carried out
               in 2005-2006, and summarize views from stakeholder and Member
               States. The prospect of a B-USO must however be seen in the
               context of other initiatives and emphasis on broadband as a means
               to achieve a more dynamic European economy, and therefore various
               policy initiatives related to broadband are summarized. The paper
               will also offer some issues to consider for a broadband USO, from
               a general standpoint. As a conclusion, the paper will identify
               selected issues in implementing such a regulation.",

              financial targets, require new ways of organizing transport and
              mobility. Cities have challenges with emissions and congestion
              while rural areas have problems organizing transport services
              efficiently due to long distances, sparse population and narrow
              flows of people and goods. Thus, a collaboration of different
              stakeholders and combining different transport services are a
              prerequisite for viable and attractive MaaS services. MaaS
              business models presented in this study are based on the findings
              of two MaaS projects: European MAASiFiE project studying the MaaS
              concept widely at European level, and a Finnish MaaS project
              concentrating on identifying and developing preconditions for
              accessible and lasting rural mobility. The business models can
              facilitate the development of MaaS services in different contexts,
              and especially in rural areas by offering extensive business
              models for service development. The focus is especially on MaaS
              durable business models for rural areas including the organizing
              of statutory social and health service transportation, which
              inefficiency has been a big debate in Finland. A total of five

  abstract = "The passenger transport sector is being affected by several major
              trends. These trends alter the requirements of the transport
              system, thus creating a challenge to the city development.
              However, it seems that the current organization of the public
              transport service provision in Helsinki fails to sufficiently
              respond to the challenge. Simultaneously, the objective of the
              national transport policy is to increase the share of sustainable
              travel modes. In addition to the altering requirements, modern
              technology, such as means of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS),
              provide a spectrum of possibilities in the field. The deployment
              of ITS could contribute to more efficient utilization of
              resources, including infrastructure and fleet, improved fluidity
              of traffic due to real time information, and attractive provision
              of mobility services. Having said this, it appears that the
              passenger transport sector in Helsinki needs to be transformed. In
              order to discover a possible form and course for the
              transformation, the Helsinki City Planning Department has procured
              this study. This study discovers a way to reorganize the passenger
              transport sector so that it would promote the concept of “Mobility
              as a Service” (MaaS), that is, convenient provision of a
              versatility of attractive mobility services. This study provides a
              suggestion of a transformed mobility sector. Furthermore, it
              provides a scheduled proposal for action for executing the
              transformation. The study examined former transformations in four
              industries: telecommunications, energy, airline, and railroad
              industries. The author aimed to identify the most significant
              factors that contributed to the success of the transformations.
              These numerous factors were then formed into proposals for action
              and crystallized into seven most considerable ones. The seven
              proposed actions were then appointed to a time scale from 2015 to
              2025, thus creating a road map for the transformation of the
              passenger transport sector in Helsinki. The results show that all
              stakeholders should cooperate in the transformation, and
              legislation as well as regulation should be revised. In addition,
              purchase and subsidization procedures, as well as mobility service
              provision should be reorganized, and transformed operations
              established. Additionally, pilots should be conducted from the
              beginning to gain practical experience.",

  abstract = "Social activities such as visiting friends or participating in
              community groups have been shown to correlate positively with
              active health promotion, more frequent physical exercise, and
              maintenance of activities of daily living in older people. Social
              inactivity may result from personal factors such as physical
              condition and from environmental factors such as limited means of
              transportation. To study the latter factors, we focused on
              perceived transportation difficulties and on the influence of
              those perceptions on the daily activities of elderly people. We
              sought to test the hypothesis that perceived transportation
              problems restrict health promotion or social activities and
              accelerate the decline in activities of daily living, and also to
              determine how transportation can be improved. A questionnaire was
              sent to 238 people (a fifth of the population) aged 60 years or
              older who were living in a small town in Kanagawa prefecture.
              Buses are the principal mode of public transportation from their
              residences to the nearest train station and the trip takes about
              50 minutes. Responses were received from 190 persons (83.3\%,
              excluding those who had died, moved, or were in the hospital). Of
              the respondents, 166 (74 men and 92 women) went out by themselves
              and their responses were subjected to logistic regression
              analysis. The results revealed the following points. (1) For both
              men and women, riding buses to the hospital was associated with a
              greater perception of problems with respect to convenience,
              physical exertion, or anxiety when crossing the road. (2) Among
              women, greater perceived inconvenience of transportation
              correlated with a lower frequency of going out for daily shopping;
              a higher frequency of visiting friends correlated with greater
              perception of physical exertion. (3) Among women, the main desire
              was to visit friends. Men indicated that they wanted to be more
              active in hobbies. The women indicated that the main reason they
              do not fulfill their desires was that transportation is
              inconvenient. These findings indicate that perceived
              transportation problems can prevent elderly people, especially
              women, from going out for health promotion and social activities.
              This indicates that to support social activities of elderly
              people, the means of transportation should be made more convenient
              and more physically accessible, and local circumstances should be
              taken into consideration.",

               experience stress when delivering public services to clients, for
               instance because of high workloads. They adapt by coping, using
               such practices as breaking or bending rules for clients, or
               rationing services. Although coping is recognized as an important
               response to the problems of frontline work, the public
               administration field lacks a comprehensive view of coping. The
               first contribution of this article is therefore theoretical:
               conceptualizing coping during public service delivery and
               developing a coherent classification of coping. This is done via
               a systematic review of the literature from 1981 to 2014. The
               second contribution is empirical: via a systematic review of the
               literature from 1981–2014 this article provides a framework and
               analytical account of how coping during public service delivery
               has been studied since 1980. It highlights the importance of the
               type of profession (such as being a teacher or a police officer),
               the amount of workload, and the degree of discretion for
               understanding how frontline workers cope with stress. It also
               reveals that frontline workers often draw on the coping family
               “moving towards clients” revealing a strong tendency to provide
               meaningful public service to clients, even under stressful
               conditions. We conclude with an agenda for future studies,
               examining new theoretical, methodological and empirical
               opportunities to advance understanding of coping during public

  abstract  = "“Wicked problems” are often thought of as a situation that should
               not exist or an inescapable consequence of complex systems. This
               paper argues for a paradigm shift in instead understanding wicked
               problems as feedback from the system (i.e., the real world),
               resulting from a misalignment between our mental model of the
               system and the system itself, rather than inevitable outcomes of
               complex systems. Through a systems literature review (SLR) on
               effective policy and two surveys sampling the US population in
               order to understand how people are thinking about today’s biggest
               crises, this paper explores the prevalence of this traditional
               approach to problem solving. Essentially, wicked problems are the
               real-world system informing us that our mental model is flawed.
               When confronted with wicked problems involving webs of causality
               (as all wicked problems do), people often fail to recognize the
               needed solutions as a corollary web of actions, instead
               emphasizing linear causal relationships, or “root causes.” This
               problem-solving approach has significant consequences, as it
               overlooks the symmetry between the web of causality generating
               the problems and the web of solutions that would remedy them.
               This oversight leads to the implementation of partial solutions
               divorced from the dynamacy of interaction effects, which in turn
               leads policy and decision makers to conclude that critical parts
               of a web of solutions have been ineffective, and thus excluding
               them from future interventions. This is especially relevant for
               influential policy makers, planners, and decision makers.
               However, changing this mindset is in itself a wicked problem. The
               traditional approach to problems and systems is ineffective,
               necessitating a more systemic approach to policy. Our
               statistically significant findings confirm the prevalence of the
               traditional approach, prompting the recommendation for a more
               holistic education in critical analysis and systems thinking to
               address the web of causes that produce “wicked problems.” This is
               particularly critical for individuals being trained for careers
               in policy and planning.",

               paper, the process is researched in which how the concept of
               so-called New Public has been adopted in the policies of Japanese
               government. The concept of New Public was clearly stated in
               National Spatial Strategy of 2008 as the cabinet decision which
               is the most important decision and expression medium of the
               government. It is considered useful to study the process how the
               concept of New Public has been discussed in the series of
               National Spatial Strategies for further understanding of the
               relationship between the concept of New Public and the local
               communities in Japan. In this research the discussion process in
               the National Spatial Strategies is reviewed precisely as a
               framework in order to secure sustainability and independence of
               local communities based on the actual situation in which various
               non-governmental sectors are playing active roles in enlarged
               public fields. It is going to be indicated that the concept of
               New Public has multi-faceted meaning such as improving
               satisfaction level of individuals, and it is emphasized that the
               adoption of the concept was a noticeable policy change.",

               an authoritative role in reducing uncertainty and ambiguity. But
               is science up to the task? This is far from self-evident. The
               demands on science in times of crisis run counter to the values
               of good, normal science. Crisis science needs to be fast,
               univocal, personalized, and direct, while normal science is slow,
               contentious, collective, and sensitive to complexity. Science can
               only play its atypical role if it is staged in the public arena.
               Some patterns of staging stand out: personalization,
               visualization, and connection to lived experiences. So far, the
               staging of science has been successful, but it is fragile. The
               COVID-19 crisis shows the potential of well-staged forms of
               alliance between science and policy, but when the general
               assumption is that scientists will ``solve'' societal
               ``problems,'' the staging of science has gone too far.",

               of policy problems is in fact analytical. Wicked policy problems
               are difficult to identify and interpret. The knowledge base for
               analysing wicked policy problem is typically fragmented and
               contested. Available evidence is incomplete, inconclusive and
               incommensurable. In this situation, the evidentiary and the
               interpretative elements of policy analysis become increasingly
               indistinguishable and inseparably intertwined. The article
               reveals the problems this poses for policy analysis and explores
               the extent to which the consolidation, consensualization and
               contestation of evidence in policy analysis offer alternative

                   lack mechanisms to adapt their weights in response to new
                   tasks, knowledge, or examples. We introduce Self-Adapting
                   LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to self-adapt by
                   generating their own finetuning data and update directives.
                   Given a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a
                   generation that may restructure the information in different
                   ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or invoke tools
                   for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
                   supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in
                   persistent weight updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To
                   train the model to produce effective self-edits, we use a
                   reinforcement learning loop with the downstream performance
                   of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior
                   approaches that rely on separate adaptation modules or
                   auxiliary networks, SEAL directly uses the model's own
                   generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments on
                   knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that
                   SEAL is a promising step toward language models capable of
                   self-directed adaptation. Our website and code is available

                   in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical
                   frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena
                   through a unified mathematical lens. We establish the first
                   formal connection between LLM architectures and Algorithmic
                   Information Theory (AIT) by proving two fundamental results:
                   (1) the training process computationally approximates
                   Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as
                   program length optimization, and (2) next-token prediction
                   implements approximate Solomonoff induction. We leverage AIT
                   to provide a unified theoretical explanation for in-context
                   learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore,
                   our theoretical insights lead to a principled method for
                   few-shot example selection that prioritizes samples where
                   models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We demonstrate
                   through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks
                   that this strategy yields significant performance
                   improvements, particularly for smaller model architectures,
                   when compared to selecting high-confidence examples. Our
                   framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and
                   practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and
                   actionable insights for future model development.",

               based on a poor foundation. This paper highlights an alternative
               philosophy to positivism which can also underpin empirical
               inquiry, that of post-positivism. Post-positivism is contrasted
               with positivism, which is presented as an outmoded and rejected
               philosophy which should cease to significantly shape inquiry.
               Though some acknowledgement of post-positivism has occurred in
               the nursing literature, this has yet to permeate into mainstream
               nursing research. Many still base their arguments on a
               positivistic view of science. Through achievement of a better
               understanding of post-positivism and greater focus on explicating

               time, the study of foreign policy has been largely unaffected by
               the critical insights offered by post-positivism. This paper
               attempts to bridge this gap by examining three approaches to

               traditional ways of studying foreign policy and can facilitate a
               more critical interpretation of foreign policy practices. The
               first two approaches, the Cognitive Decisionmaking Approach and
               the Social Performance Approach, were chosen as a way of
               differentiating and highlighting the ontological and theoretical

               has rightly highlighted the social and political context of
               theories. Its impact through various guises including
               collaborative, postmodern and neo-pragmatic approaches has been
               significant. However, one area that has been immune to these
               broad changes and interpretations is typologies of planning.
               Typologies provide heuristics for academics and practitioners
               that help map the landscape of ideas that influence a particular
               field. As such they are crucial to any understanding of a diverse
               theoretical area such as planning. This article seeks to develop
               a post-positivist typology for planning theory. My typology is
               based upon the broad themes of post-positivism including the
               belief that all theory is to greater or lesser degrees normative,
               a non-linear conception of time and progress and the introduction
               of spatial and temporal variance in any understanding of the
               formulation, interpretation and application of theory. The result
               is an approach that does away with two traditional planning
               theory dualisms - the procedural-substantive distinction and the
               theory-practice gap. It also provides a locally diverse and
               unique interpretation of planning theory at the national and
               sub-national scale that rejects the idea that local
               interpretation of theories and their application can be assumed
               to be consistent with ideas operating at a higher (often

                   imitating linguistic patterns without genuine understanding.
                   We argue that recent findings in mechanistic interpretability
                   (MI), the emerging field probing the inner workings of LLMs,
                   render this picture increasingly untenable--but only once
                   those findings are integrated within a theoretical account of
                   understanding. We propose a tiered framework for thinking
                   about understanding in LLMs and use it to synthesize the most
                   relevant findings to date. The framework distinguishes three
                   hierarchical varieties of understanding, each tied to a
                   corresponding level of computational organization: conceptual
                   understanding emerges when a model forms ``features'' as
                   directions in latent space, learning connections between
                   diverse manifestations of a single entity or property;
                   state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns
                   contingent factual connections between features and
                   dynamically tracks changes in the world; principled
                   understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on
                   memorized facts and discovers a compact ``circuit''
                   connecting these facts. Across these tiers, MI uncovers
                   internal organizations that can underwrite understanding-like
                   unification. However, these also diverge from human cognition
                   in their parallel exploitation of heterogeneous mechanisms.
                   Fusing philosophical theory with mechanistic evidence thus
                   allows us to transcend binary debates over whether AI
                   understands, paving the way for a comparative,
                   mechanistically grounded epistemology that explores how AI

               articles—indicate that our index proxies for movements in
               policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near

               is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no

               problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no
